Water acts like a weak adhesive by creating suction . It is a similar effect that causes two sheets of glass separated by a thin film of water to stick to each other with great force .' 'I remember getting my feet drenched in a downpour while wearing converse and some thick socks ... Practically took my leg off in the end !' 'Intermolecular forces . There are four kinds of intermolecular forces . Water has three . The first is just general dispersion forces , which all molecules and atoms have . This is basically when random movements of electrons create temporary and minor positive / negative charges between two atoms , pulling them together . But these charges are so fleeting though , that this force overall is n't very strong . The next strongest is dipole - dipole , which occurs because of a difference of electronegativities in atoms of a molecule . This occurs in water because Oxygen is much more electronegative ( attracts electrons ) , than Hydrogen . The net effect is an overall partial charge , or dipole , on the water molecule , with a more negative side being on the Oxygen . This then can attract the more positively charged atoms on some other molecule , and so on . The final intermolecular force water has ( and the strongest of all ) is Hydrogen bonding , which can only occur with Oxygen , Nitrogen , and Florine on other molecules . Essentially , O , N , and F are all very electronegative , and so something similar to what happens with dipole - dipole occurs , and a \\\" bond \\\" is formed ( called a bond but not actually ) . Also different from dipole - dipole is the fact these Hydrogen bonds must be done in such a way that the H is essentially pulled by two different highly Electronegative atoms ( one of which is covalently bonded to H , the other Hydrogen bonded ) . This is how the different molecules ( A , T , G , C ) of the rungs of DNA are held together . Anyway , water has all these great IM forces going on , and that means it can create lots of attraction to itself ( cohesion ) and with other molecules ( adhesion ) quite well , ultimately making it hard to pull off your wet clothing . The fourth by the way is ion - dipole , which is just like dipole - dipole , but you have a greater difference in EN ( electronegativity ) , because one of the elements is an ion like Mg2 + or F- .

That's a high level analysis and the devil is in the details - higher oil prices may favour electric car producers for example or discount clothes retailers vs. branded clothes manufacturers. Another approach it to use a statistical analysis. I have run a quick and dirty correlation of the various S&P sector indices against the oil prices (Crude). Based on the the results below, you would conclude that materials and energy stocks should perform well with rising oil prices. There again, it is a behaviour you would expect at the group level but it may not translate to each individual company within those groups (in particular in the materials sector where some would benefit and some would be detrimentally affected). You could get exposure to those sectors using ETFs, such as XLB and XLE in the US. Or you could run the same analysis for each stock within the S&P 500 (or whatever index you are looking at) and create a portfolio with the stocks that are the most correlated with oil prices.

            "'Redlines are arbitrary figures worked out by engineers and possibly tweaked at times by the marketing people . ( A higher redline might seem sexier to a young male customer ) You can throw a rod ( catastrophically break a connecting rod ) at any RPM , but the statistical likelihood that it will occur increases with RPMs . Engines wear out eventually , regardless of RPMs , but they wear out much faster if the average RPM is higher . There is also the question of torque and horsepower . Horsepower = torque X RPM . In theory , more RPMs mean more horsepower , which is why racing engines run at much higher RPMs . That \\'s also why they wear out faster and sometimes blow up during races . There is an RPM point at which any piston engine will start to lose torque . Beyond that point , more RPMs produce less horsepower , not more . The most common reason would be valve \" float . \" The valves can not open and close fast enough to keep up with the engine rotation . Before they snap closed , the cam is starting to push them open again . The engine will sputter and falter . Stronger valve springs and lighter valves make higher RPM limits possible . These are used in racing engines . Some engines ca n\\'t breathe enough air or suck enough gasoline to keep up , beyond a certain RPM point . At higher RPMs , most engines suck a lot of gasoline , so gas mileage plummets . For passenger cars , engineers take all of these things into account arbitrarily chose an RPM \" redline . \" Some newer passenger cars electronically limit RPMs . Your car might have more power beyond the redline , or it might not . You can figure it out by trial and error , or you can take it to a speed shop and put it on a dynamometer . On the other hand , think about whether you can afford to replace the engine .\\' \"The engineers who designed the engine did so assuming that the engine would never go above the redline RPM . This is just a necessity of the design process -- you ca n\\'t design something that works in literally every condition . If you go above the redline limit , any number of things could happen , and it \\'s hard to tell which because the engine was n\\'t designed to run that hard . It will probably work just fine for brief periods of time . But then again , it may not . The engine may literally shake itself apart . Or it overheats and burns up a gasket or something . Best not to test it .\" \"Some engines have a rev limiter which prevents this from happening . But if it does happen , it really depends on the engine . In some cases , the valves wo n\\'t be able to close fast enough and the engine will lose power . Other than this , there is nothing specifically bad which will happen immediately - but high rpm will wear your engine out faster , and above the red line , some of the moving parts may not last very long before they break .'\n",
            "'Torque is angular force . It \\'s how hard you can twist something . Kilowatts is the total power output , which is how hard you can twist something and how many times you can twist it . For instance , if you were shoveling mud , torque would be how much mud you can lift in your shovel , rpm would be how many times per minute you can lift the shovel , and kilowatts ( or horsepower , which is just 1 hp = 0.76 kw ) is how much mud you can move overall , which is the product of the two . So if your shovel holds 5 kg of mud , and shovel it 45 times per minute , your mud output is 225 kg per minute . Or , if your shovel holds 25 kg of mud , and you shovel it 9 times per minute , you \\'d also have a 225 kg per minute output .\" \\'Torque is a measure of the rotational force you are applying to an object , or in ELI5 terms , how hard you are twisting it . Power , measured in kW or HP , is just how much torque you are applying over time , or in ELI5 terms , how fast you can twist it while still applying the same force . If you can twist something really hard , but not very fast you are producing a lot of torque but not much power . If you can twist something really hard and do it really fast you create more power . In a car , both are important , some engines are designed to create a lot of torque to move heavy objects , like trucks , and other engines , like those in race cars , are designed to maximize peak power output ( less torque than a truck , but can rotate really fast ) .\\' \"Since you \\'re asking specifically about cars , let \\'s talk about that . First off , horsepower is not a force , it does n\\'t move a car in any way shape or form . The only force responsible for making a car move is torque , period . What horsepower is is an attempt to quantify how efficiently an engine uses it \\'s torque at a given RPM . To be more specific , horsepower is the sum of an equation that measures torque and rpm . Now you may be inclined to think that more torque = faster car , but that \\'s not true . For example , a Ford F350 might have 550ft / lbs of torque but it would lose a drag race to my mom \\'s maxima which has less than 300ft / lbs . And F1 cars about 10 years ago only made 285ft / lbs of torque , but they \\'d run a quarter mile in under 10 seconds . So how is that possible ? The answer is horsepower ( or really , what horsepower represents ) . An engine moves a car by making explosions , and each explosion is a brief burst of torque . Of course we \\'ve developed engines to be smooth so you do n\\'t notice these individual explosions , but it \\'s still a series of explosions that propel a car forward . So each explosions creates * an * amount of torque for * a * period of time . And that \\'s what horsepower is , work over time . Looking at an engine this would be roughly \\' explosions per minute \\' . So let \\'s look at that F350 and say it makes 550ft / lbs at 2,000rpm . Well that \\'s 550ft / lbs 2000 times every minute , which totals 1,100,000ft / lbs each minute . However an F1 car that makes 285ft / lbs at 22,000rpm totals 6,270,000ft / lbs each minute . So the reason an F1 car can accelerate more quickly than an F350 , despite having less torque , is because it \\'s \\' creating \\' that torque many more times per second ( and its weight , but that \\'s another discussion ) . edit : huh , apparently everybody in this response thread got downvoted'\n",

            "'Involuntary manslaughter means that you killed them in improper circumstances , but without intent to have killed someone . Murder requires that you set out to kill someone , intentionally . This is a summary of \" constructive manslaughter \" : > For example , a person who runs a red light driving a vehicle and hits someone crossing the street could be found to intend or be reckless as to assault or criminal damage ( see DPP v Newbury[3 ] ) . There is no intent to kill , and a resulting death would not be considered murder , but would be considered involuntary manslaughter . The accused \\'s responsibility for causing death is constructed from the fault in committing what might have been a minor criminal act . Reckless drinking or reckless handling of a potentially lethal weapon may result in a death that is deemed manslaughter . > Involuntary manslaughter may be distinguished from accidental death . A person who is driving carefully , but whose car nevertheless hits a child darting out into the street , has not committed manslaughter . A person who pushes off an aggressive drunk , who then falls and dies , has probably not committed manslaughter , although in some jurisdictions it may depend whether \" excessive force \" was used or other factors . And negligent : > Criminally negligent manslaughter occurs where there is an omission to act when there is a duty to do so , or a failure to perform a duty owed , which leads to a death . The existence of the duty is essential because the law does not impose criminal liability for a failure to act unless a specific duty is owed to the victim . It is most common in the case of professionals who are grossly negligent in the course of their employment . An example is where a doctor fails to notice a patient \\'s oxygen supply has disconnected and the patient dies ( R v Adomako ) . It \\'s important to note that both types of manslaughter require some kind of misbehavior on the part of the person ( and that the death is a result of that ) , and not just that someone dies . To be charged with murder , you need to intend to kill someone .\\' \\'> Why does n\\'t attempted murder get punished as harshly as murder ? For the same reason ~~as~~ a \" shot on goal \" that misses is n\\'t celebrated the same as an actual goal . Regardless , attempted murder is still a very serious crime with harsh punishment . > Why does involuntary manslaughter get punished at all ? Because a life was lost and someone was deemed responsible for it , despite the lack of intent . The term does n\\'t apply anytime there is a death . Perhaps you can explain what part does n\\'t make sense to you ? Edit : Grammar .\\' \"Because by punishing attempted murder less than actual murder , we create a situation where someone can reconsider in the commission of a crime .

            "'(Real) interest rates are so low because governments want people to use their money to improve the economy by spending or investing rather than saving. Their idea is that by consuming or investing you will help to create jobs that will employ people who will spend or invest their pay, and so on. If you want to keep this money for the future you don\\'t want to spend it and interest rates make saving unrewarding therefore you ought to invest. That was the why, now the how. Inflation protected securities, mentioned in another answer, are the least risk way to do this. These are government guaranteed and very unlikely to default. On the other hand deflation will cause bigger problems for you and the returns will be pitiful compared with historical interest rates. So what else can be done? Investing in companies is one way of improving returns but risk starts to increase so you need to decide what risk profile is right for you. Investing in companies does not mean having to put money into the stock market either directly or indirectly (through funds) although index tracker funds have good returns and low risk. The corporate bond market is lower risk for a lesser reward than the stock market but with better returns than current interest rates. Investment grade bonds are very low risk, especially in the current economic climate and there are exchange traded funds (ETFs) to diversify more risk away.

            "'In the United States, the death penalty is a legal punishment for certain crimes. When someone is sentenced to death, they are placed on what is called \"death row,\" which is a part of a prison where people who have been sentenced to death are held while they wait for their execution. There are several reasons why people on death row may have to wait many years for their execution. One reason is that the legal process can be very slow. There are many steps involved in a death penalty case, including appeals, which can take a long time to resolve. Another reason is that there are often challenges to the use of the death penalty, and these challenges can also take a long time to resolve. For example, people may argue that the death penalty is unconstitutional, or that the person being sentenced to death did not receive a fair trial. These challenges can lead to delays in the execution process. Finally, some states have placed a moratorium on the death penalty, which means that they have stopped carrying out executions until certain issues can be addressed. All of these factors can contribute to the length of time that people on death row have to wait for their execution.'\n",
            "'Smoke detectors are designed to detect certain types of smoke. The smoke from cigarettes and fireplaces is usually not dense enough to trigger the sensor in a smoke detector, but the smoke produced when something is burning, like toast, is often denser and can set off the alarm. The sensor in a smoke detector is usually a small, glowing wire called a \"ionization chamber.\" When smoke particles enter the chamber, they interfere with the flow of ions, which causes the sensor to trigger the alarm. Some smoke detectors also have a second type of sensor called a \"photoelectric\" sensor, which is more sensitive to larger smoke particles. This type of sensor is more likely to be triggered by the smoke produced when something is burning, like toast. I hope this helps explain it! Let me know if you have any more questions.'\n",

            "\"There are a few reasons why license plates might be blurred out on TV. One reason is to protect the privacy of the person who owns the car. Even though the car is in a public place, the owner of the car has a right to keep their personal information private. Blurring out the license plate helps to prevent anyone from being able to easily track down the owner of the car. Another reason for blurring out license plates is to protect the identity of the person driving the car. For example, if a news program is showing a video of a crime being committed, they might want to obscure the license plate of the car so that the person responsible for the crime cannot be easily identified. Finally, blurring out license plates is also sometimes done for aesthetic reasons. If the license plate is especially dirty or difficult to read, it might be blurred out to make the video look better. In general, it's a good idea to be mindful of other people's privacy and to respect their right to keep their personal information private, even if that information is in a public place.\"\n",

            "\"Torque is a measure of the rotational force that an engine or motor can produce. It is typically measured in Newton meters (Nm) or foot-pounds (ft-lb). Torque is important because it determines how much power an engine can deliver to the wheels of a vehicle. Kilowatts (kW) is a unit of power. Power is a measure of how quickly work can be done. In the case of a car, power is used to determine how quickly the vehicle can accelerate or how much load it can pull. Power is typically measured in watts (W) or kilowatts (kW). To put it simply, torque is a measure of how much force an engine can produce, while kilowatts is a measure of how much power it can produce. For example, imagine trying to lift a heavy object. If you have a lot of torque, it means you can apply a lot of force to the object and lift it easily. On the other hand, if you don't have much torque, you might struggle to lift the object. Similarly, in a car, if an engine has a lot of torque, it can easily accelerate the car and climb steep hills. If it has less torque, it might struggle to do the same.\"\n",

Companies that are able to reduce their emissions below the limit can sell their extra credits to other companies that need them.

            "\"Attempted murder and involuntary manslaughter are considered less serious crimes than murder because they involve less intent or less serious actions. In the case of attempted murder, the person accused of the crime did not actually succeed in killing someone. They may have tried to do so, but they were not successful. This is why the punishment for attempted murder is usually less severe than for murder. Involuntary manslaughter, on the other hand, is when someone causes the death of another person by accident or through reckless or negligent behavior, rather than on purpose. For example, if a driver is texting while driving and causes a car accident that leads to someone's death, they may be charged with involuntary manslaughter. In these cases, the person did not mean to cause someone's death, but their actions were still reckless or negligent and led to a death. This is why involuntary manslaughter is punished, but the punishment is usually not as severe as it would be for murder. I hope this helps to explain the difference between these crimes and why they are punished differently.\"\n",

            "'During the summer of 2011, there were several factors that contributed to an upward spike in U.S. Treasury yields, even as the S&P downgraded the credit rating of U.S. government debt. One factor was the debt ceiling crisis that was playing out at the time. In July 2011, the U.S. government reached its statutory debt limit, which meant that it could not borrow any more money unless Congress raised the debt ceiling. This led to a tense negotiation between Congressional Democrats and Republicans over raising the debt ceiling, which ultimately resulted in the passage of the Budget Control Act of 2011.Another factor that may have contributed to the upward spike in Treasury yields was the overall economic uncertainty at the time. The U.S. was still recovering from the financial crisis of 2008, and there were concerns about the strength of the recovery. In addition, there were concerns about the potential impact of the European debt crisis on the U.S. economy.Finally, the S&P downgrade of U.S. government debt may also have contributed to the upward spike in Treasury yields. The downgrade, which was announced on August 5, 2011, lowered the credit rating of U.S. government debt from AAA to AA+. This caused investors to become more wary of holding U.S. government debt, which may have led to an increase in yields as investors demanded higher returns to compensate for the perceived increased risk.'\n",
