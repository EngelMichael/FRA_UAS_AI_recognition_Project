Atomic Mass ( the average weight of an atom of this substance ): which says how much the element ways assuming you have the normal distribution of isotopes . Anything else ?', '[ Example : Iron ] ( URL_0 ) The most important number is the element 's atomic number . This is the number of protons in an atom of the element . This is the defining characteristic of the element . ( Usually , an atom will have the same number of electrons as protons \\u2013 this is its uncharged , \\\" un - ionized \\\" form . However , if an atom gains or loses electrons , it remains the same element . If it were to gain or lose a proton , it would be a different element . ) The other number usually printed on a periodic table is the element 's atomic mass . This is the average mass of an atom of the element in multiples of the mass of a proton * . Some atoms of a given element may have more neutrons in the nucleus than others ; an element with a given number of neutrons is called an \\\" isotope \\\" . The number on the table indicates the average mass , as found in nature . Elements that are never found in nature instead have the mass of their most stable isotope shown in parentheses . * The units are actually Atomic Mass Units ( amu ) or Unified Atomic Mass Units ( u ) , also called daltons ( Da ) . They are very nearly precisely the mass of a proton or neutron ( whose masses are themselves almost the same ) .', \\\"So if you look at the periodic table , For each element , the number on the top left is The Atomic Number ( the number of protons ) . It will then give the symbol and then below that is the Atomic Weight ( how many grams it would weigh if you had 6.02 * 10 ^ 23 atoms ) So horizontally , they 're laid out in order of their Atomic number . Some columns are grouped up by the atoms that have the same number of Valence electrons . So Na ( sodium ) and K ( Potassium ) both have 1 valence electron and they 're vertically next to each other on the table . That means they react similarly to other molecules .

Security: Some browsers are better at protecting you from online threats like viruses and malware. They may have features like a built-in virus scanner or a warning system that alerts you if you're about to visit a potentially dangerous website. Ease of use: Some browsers are designed to be more user-friendly, with features like easy-to-use tabs and bookmarking tools, or a simple interface that makes it easier to navigate the web. Compatibility: Some websites and web applications may only work properly on certain browsers, so it's important to choose a browser that is compatible with the websites you use most often. Extensions and plugins: Some browsers allow you to add extra features and tools through extensions and plugins, which can be helpful if you want to customize your browsing experience or add specific functionality.

Both types of business structure have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the one that is best for you will depend on your specific needs.A sole proprietorship is a type of business that is owned and operated by a single individual. It is the simplest and most common form of business structure, and it offers complete control and flexibility to the owner. However, a sole proprietorship also puts the owner's personal assets at risk, as the owner is personally liable for all debts and obligations of the business.On the other hand, an LLC is a business structure that combines elements of both a corporation and a partnership. It offers the limited liability protection of a corporation, which means that the owner's personal assets are generally not at risk if the business is sued or incurs debts. An LLC also offers more flexibility in terms of management and taxation than a corporation. However, forming and maintaining an LLC can be more complex and costly than a sole proprietorship.Ultimately, the decision between a sole proprietorship and an LLC will depend on your business goals and personal circumstances.

Whole life will cover your burial , and not a lot more . The good thing about whole life is you can borrow from it when you need .

That sounds like a lot of money , but it \\'s really not - it has to pay for : * My funeral expenses ( about $ 10,000 is usual ) * Child care OR a \" salary \" so that my wife can continue her current lifestyle as if she were still getting my paycheque ( well , a reduced paycheque , but also no bills I would normally accrue ) * My daughter \\'s future ability to attend university . * And possibly , any plans my wife and I had for retirement - I still want her to be able to travel the world or attend university if she wants . My insurance will last for 20 years ; at that point , my premiums will go up if I choose to renew . Now , let \\'s assume the best : I survive this 20 year period . By that point , I will have paid $ 18,000 and gotten nothing in return . However , in 20 years , my mortgage will be fully paid off and my daughter will already be at university ( and her RESP will be maxed out as well ) . At that point , I wo n\\'t need to have a large insurance policy - my wife will be able to maintain her standard of living without me . In a worst - case scenario , of course , I die - and my wife and family will be able to get by just as well as if I had not died ( financially , at least ) . The alternative is that I pay that $ 75 a month into a savings account . I hope that the meagre interest earned will outpace the rate of inflation , and I resolutely refuse to touch it .

And then they have to face the facts : they ca n\\'t keep the house without my income , they just might have to scrap any plans of my daughter ever getting a post - secondary education , and they could even end up sinking into poverty . Giving up a new car ? Worth it to me .\\', \\'Not an expert by any means : Savings accounts typically have very low interest rates , not really very useful because they often do not outpace inflation ( which is ~3 % annually ) . But , the money is 100 % by the government up to $ 250,000 per account . Term life insurance is like car insurance : you buy a set amount ( say $ 1,000,000 ) and pay monthly premiums for it . If you die while you are covered , your dependents or spouse gets $ 1,000,000 worth of coverage for burial expenses , payment of your debts , replacment of your income that you are not making because you are now dead , etc . But , regardless of how long you have the coverage - 3 months or 35 years - it is still just $ 1,000,000 no matter how much you have paid towards it . Whole life insurance ( the other type ) is - as it sounds - coverage for you whole life and is more like a savings account . You accrue the money that you put into the insurance plan and receive dividends ( interest on the money in the account ) from the insurance company along the way . The dividend rate is better than a the interest rate of a savings account , but not as high as some other investment devices . Your equity grows as time passes and you continue to pay into it . After a while , the account will contain a lot of money and you can access the money to put it towards other investments or purchases . However , whole - life insurance costs much more than term - 4 or 5x as much , I believe . TL;DR - Savings Account - low interest , essentially zero risk Term Insurance - low rates , short - term coverage , does not accrue equity or pay interest , low risk Whole - life Insurance - high rates , long - term coverage , accrues equity and pays interest , some risk ( someone else probably knows more about this aspect of WLI )'\n",

Let \\'s say you have someone who \\'s a really smart professor ( the processor ) and you want him to help you with a problem .

Now let \\'s say you know some Spanish , but communicating with the translator that way is just annoying . So you finally get a friend to translate from Spanish to English ( programming languages like C or C++ ) .

This information is further split into smaller and smaller packets of data until it eventually arrives at a certain component that can read that string of 1s and 0s and generally perform a basic physical action ( e.g. change the voltage on a wire , or change the charge on a metal disk ) .

This is especially harmful because places where Fracking commonly takes place is lacking water already ( In Texas : Barnett Shale , Eagle Ford Shale are both big ones ) .

While conventional oil and gas wells are permitted and regulated through a variety of programs ( e.g. EPA \\'s Underground Injection Control program ) , fracking is exempt unless they inject diesel compounds underground ( a rarity ) .

The Gregorian calendar adds on the rule that every year divisible by 100 is * not * a leap year , except those years which are divisible by 400 . TL;DR : As a result of this , Julian calendar is faster than an actual solar year by one day every 128 years . Gregorian is faster than an actual solar year by one day every 3,030 years . All facts gained from the [ wikipidia article ] ( URL_0 ) on the subject .\\', \"The Julian calendar assumes that a year is 365.25 days , whereas the Gregorian calendar recognizes that a year is 365.25 days -11 minutes .

This is why the year 2000 was not a leap year , even though it should have been . The Gregorian calendar is , therefore , more accurate and that is the reason we use it instead . People might not think the difference is important or useful , but it \\'s important that everyone uses the same calendar , just like it \\'s important for everyone to use the same system of measurement for time , and that system be as accurate as possible . Bonus fun fact : Greece was still using the Julian calendar into 1922 .\", \\'More to the point , the Julian and Gregorian calendars have the same purpose . Julian was invented first . Gregorian was a very slight modification to Julian to be more accurate ( with respect to the actual revolution of Earth around the Sun ) . Julian is not normally used anymore , almost everyone uses Gregorian ( if they use a Christian - based calendar at all ) . We use Gregorian because it is more accurate than Julian . When the Gregorian calendar was invented , Julian was about 10 days off from where it was really supposed to be , so the transition was made by declaring that the day after 4 October 1582 was 15 Oct 1582 ( thus skipping 10 days ) . As other regions started changing from Julian to Gregorian , they too skipped the needed number of days to get to the correct day . For example , the British Empire changed from Julian to Gregorian in the year 1752 ( at this time the Empire included what is now the United States ) . So they had to skip 11 days instead of just 10 . Currently the Julian calendar is 13 days off , so today which is 23 January 2018 , in Julian would be 10 January . ( The other posts mention the difference between the calendar themselves . Which is : in the Julian calendar a leap year is every 4 years , in the years divisible by 4 . In the Gregorian calendar , all common years [ i.e. not leap years ] remain common years , but a few leap years are changed to common years . Divisible by 400 [ e.g. 2000 ] remain leap years , divisible by 100 but not 400 [ e.g. 2100 ] are changed to common years , divisible by 4 but not 100 [ e.g. 2016 ] remain leap years . )'\n",
            "'In mathematics, a partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation which imposes relations between the various partial derivatives of a multivariable function. The function is often thought of as an \"unknown\" to be solved for, similarly to how x is thought of as an unknown number to be solved for in an algebraic equation like x2 − 3x + 2 = 0. However, it is usually impossible to write down explicit formulas for solutions of partial differential equations. There is, correspondingly, a vast amount of modern mathematical and scientific research on methods to numerically approximate solutions of certain partial differential equations using computers. Partial differential equations also occupy a large sector of pure mathematical research, in which the usual questions are, broadly speaking, on the identification of general qualitative features of solutions of various partial differential equations, such as existence, uniqueness, regularity, and stability.[citation needed] Among the many open questions are the existence and smoothness of solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, named as one of the Millennium Prize Problems in 2000. Partial differential equations are ubiquitous in mathematically oriented scientific fields, such as physics and engineering. For instance, they are foundational in the modern scientific understanding of sound, heat, diffusion, electrostatics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, elasticity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics (Schrödinger equation, Pauli equation, etc). They also arise from many purely mathematical considerations, such as differential geometry and the calculus of variations; among other notable applications, they are the fundamental tool in the proof of the Poincaré conjecture from geometric topology. Partly due to this variety of sources, there is a wide spectrum of different types of partial differential equations, and methods have been developed for dealing with many of the individual equations which arise. As such, it is usually acknowledged that there is no \"general theory\" of partial differential equations, with specialist knowledge being somewhat divided between several essentially distinct subfields. Ordinary differential equations form a subclass of partial differential equations, corresponding to functions of a single variable. Stochastic partial differential equations and nonlocal equations are, as of 2020, particularly widely studied extensions of the \"PDE\" notion. More classical topics, on which there is still much active research, include elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations, fluid mechanics, Boltzmann equations, and dispersive partial differential equations.'\n",

NBC settles with Conan , giving him a boatload of money to go away quietly 12 . Leno gets the Tonight Show , but with all the upheaval , ratings are n\\'t great 13 . Conan gets a show on TBS , ratings are n\\'t great\", \\'Around 2004 , while successful host of \" Late Night \" , Conan and his agents told NBC that other networks ( FOX / ABC ) were interested in bringing him on to compete head to head against Leno at 11:35pm time slot . NBC did n\\'t want to lose their bright talented young star and they negotiated that he would take over \" the Tonight Show \" from Jay in 5 years . NBC did n\\'t think Leno would still be # 1 in 2009 and told him that they would n\\'t renew his contract , and in Leno \\'s words he was \" fired , 5 years in advance . \" Leno keeps a good public face and claims to be voluntarily stepping aside to make way for Conan . Fast forward to early 2009 , months before the planned handover , Leno is still # 1 in the ratings hands down . He had preliminary talks with ABC and Jimmy Kimmel about possibly coming in to do a show as Kimmel \\'s lead - in . NBC did not want Leno to compete against them , and with their own prime time lineup in the toilet ( 4th and 5th place in 8pm-11pm ratings ) , they decide to offer him a new show at 10 pm to kill two birds with one stone . Even if Leno \\'s new show did n\\'t have big ratings , it would still be profitable as it was much cheaper to produce than scripted shows . Leno agrees to a new 5 year contract for \" The Jay Leno Show \" which debuted 3 months after \" The Tonight Show with Conan O\\'Brien \" in Sept 2009 . The ratings for both shows were awful . There were many reasons for the weak ratings . There was no precedent for a late night talk show in prime time . Most people like to watch the talk shows right before bed . Rival networks wanted the show to fail as it \\'s success would disrupt their business model so [ they barred actors on their networks ] ( URL_0 ) from appearing on Jay \\'s show . A significant part of the viewership draw is based on the celebrity guests . With a weaker guest pool , it was harder to land big name guests . People have pretty stable TV viewing habits . Both Conan and Leno \\'s long - time viewers did not alter their TV watching habits to watch their favorite host at a new time . The quality of both shows in general were considered by many to have been weaker than the previous incarnation . Conan was known for his self - deprecating , edgy , random and sometimes weird humor . He scaled it back for the Tonight Show , but his act still did n\\'t play to a wider audience . Conan says he was the fault of a weak lead in and needed more than 7 months to develop his audience . He blamed Jay Leno for the demise . In January 2010 , the local NBC affiliate stations were furious as their ratings for their nightly newscasts at 11 pm were terrible . The affiliates actually own the channels and have deals with NBC to air NBC \\'s original programming . Their local newscasts are a big moneymaker for them . They rely on strong lead - in shows from the previous hour to deliver a large part of their audience . Their nightly news ratings drop was a direct result of weak Leno and Conan ratings . The affiliates threaten to air reruns of scripted shows instead of Leno \\'s show and demanded a change be made . NBC claims for the first time ever in 40 + years , \" The Tonight Show \" was losing money for the network ( Conan vehemently denies this was possible ) . Both Leno and Conan were under contract , around $ 100 m and $ 50 m respectively . NBC proposed a compromise to move Jay back to 11:35 to only do a half hour show , Conan to 12:05 and Fallon to 1:05 . Leno and Fallon agreed while Conan famously publicly refused in an open letter and caused a media firestorm resulting in a two week often public negotiation of his exit and outpouring on the internet hivemind from \" Team Coco \" with most of the support coming from people who did n\\'t even watch his show . Leno claimed NBC told him before he agreed to move that Conan was on board with the change and that NBC would not let him out of his contract , and as he has no agent and represents himself , he did n\\'t want to fight , especially since he did n\\'t want to leave \" the Tonight Show \" in the first place . NBC did n\\'t want to let Leno go , and it was far from certain that Conan could thrive even if Leno left . Conan and others felt that Jay should just retire and step aside as he claimed to be planning the year before , which Leno admits he lied to save face . There is long standing resentment towards Leno from 1992 when he took over the \" Tonight Show \" from Johnny Carson instead of David Letterman . People felt that Leno \" stole \" the Tonight Show from Letterman and again from Conan . A lot of critics find Leno bland as well , as he attempts to appeal to a wide audience with generic material . Conan got paid $ 40m+ to leave and Jay go the Tonight Show back , where he regained the # 1 ratings spot . In my opinion , even as a huge Conan fan , Jay Leno gets an undeserved backlash . Who would turn down $ 100 m while still # 1 ? He says his staff and support crew is like his family and he did n\\'t want to leave NBC and just go to another network . I do n\\'t think his show is any worse than Letterman \\'s , who \\'s been mailing it in the past decade . I think Conan was perfect for 12:35 and never should have asked for the Tonight Show , he would \\'ve gotten it eventually instead of forcing his hand . His show on TBS is good , but he is still bitter about the incident and the ratings are not great . The real big winners are Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon ( if his new show succeeds ) . For more in - depth look , read Bill Carter \\'s book , The War for [ Late Night ] ( URL_1 )\\', \"A lot of different things happened , but to be blunt , Conan O\\'Brien did not attract as many viewers as expected . Leno eventually had his own earlier program which could be viewed as a contributing factor in O\\'Brien \\'s lack of success . However , even while Leno was still off the air , O\\'Brien \\'s new episodes were n\\'t able to beat David Letterman \\'s reruns . Based on the available information , it appears to simply be that O\\'Brien was removed because he was unable to attract as many viewers to the Tonight Show as Jay Leno .'\n",

One reason is that Oculus was originally funded through a Kickstarter campaign, which means that a lot of people backed the company and supported its development before it was acquired by Facebook. Some of these people are upset because they feel like Oculus was sold to Facebook for a lot of money, and they feel like they didn't get a fair share of the profits. Another reason is that some people are worried about Facebook's privacy practices, and they're concerned that Facebook might collect data from Oculus users and use it in ways that are not transparent or respectful of users' privacy. It's also possible that some people are just generally opposed to the idea of Facebook owning a company that makes virtual reality technology, and they're concerned about the influence that Facebook might have on the direction of Oculus and its products.

It can help provide financial security and peace of mind to your loved ones in the event that you are no longer able to provide for them. Savings accounts are a type of financial product that allow you to save and earn interest on your money. While savings accounts can be a good way to set aside money for the future, they do not provide the same level of financial protection as life insurance. There are two main types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance. Term life insurance is a type of insurance that provides coverage for a specific period of time, such as 10, 20, or 30 years. If you die during the term of the policy, your beneficiaries will receive the death benefit. If you outlive the term of the policy, the coverage will expire and you will not receive any benefit. Term life insurance is generally less expensive than permanent life insurance, but it does not build cash value over time. Permanent life insurance is a type of insurance that provides coverage for your entire life, as long as you continue to pay the premiums. Permanent life insurance policies also have a savings component, which allows you to build cash value over time. This cash value can be used to pay premiums or can be withdrawn or borrowed against. Permanent life insurance is generally more expensive than term life insurance, but it provides lifelong coverage and the ability to build cash value. I hope this helps explain the difference between life insurance and savings accounts, as well as the difference between term life insurance and permanent life insurance.

When you write a program in a programming language, you are essentially creating a list of instructions for the computer to follow.

These signals tell the machine what to do, and the machine carries out the instructions by performing physical actions, such as moving a robot arm or displaying a message on the screen.

In order to initiate a short sale, the borrower must have enough margin in their account to cover the potential loss on the trade, as well as any additional margin requirements set by the broker.To maintain a short position, the borrower must also meet any margin calls that may be issued by the broker. A margin call is a request for the borrower to add more margin to their account when the value of the collateral falls below a certain level.

Here's a simple way to think about it: imagine you have a toy car with a crank on the side. When you turn the crank, it makes the wheels of the toy car spin around. Now imagine that instead of turning the crank by hand, you could use a small explosion to turn it instead. That's kind of how a car engine works. Inside the engine, there are many cylinders (usually 4, 6, or 8) arranged in a line. Each cylinder has a piston that moves up and down inside it. The engine also has a spark plug, which is a small electrical device that creates a spark to ignite the fuel and air mixture in the cylinder.

It involves injecting a mixture of water, sand, and chemicals into the ground at high pressure to create fractures in the rock, which allows the oil and gas to flow more easily and be extracted. There are several arguments for and against fracking: ARGUMENTS FOR FRACKING: Fracking can provide a domestic source of energy: Fracking has helped the United States become less dependent on foreign sources of oil and natural gas. This can help to stabilize energy prices and reduce the need for importing energy from other countries. Fracking can create jobs: The fracking industry employs a large number of people, including engineers, geologists, and truck drivers. Fracking can lower energy prices: Fracking has helped to increase the supply of oil and natural gas, which can lower energy prices for consumers. ARGUMENTS AGAINST FRACKING: Fracking can pollute the environment: Fracking can potentially contaminate the air and water with chemicals used in the fracking process. There have also been reports of methane leaks, which contribute to climate change. Fracking can cause earthquakes: There have been instances where fracking has been linked to small earthquakes in certain areas. Fracking can impact public health: Some people believe that fracking can have negative impacts on public health, including respiratory problems and other health issues. Overall, the arguments for and against fracking are complex and there are valid points on both sides. It is important to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of fracking before making a decision about its use.'\n",
            "'The Julian calendar is a solar calendar that was used in ancient Rome. It is named after Julius Caesar, who introduced it in 46 BC. The Julian calendar has a regular year of 365 days, with an extra day added every four years to account for the fact that a solar year (the time it takes for the Earth to make one orbit around the sun) is slightly longer than 365 days. This extra day is called a \"leap day,\" and it is added to February. The Gregorian calendar is the most widely used calendar in the world today. It is a solar calendar that was introduced in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII to correct for errors in the Julian calendar. The Gregorian calendar is very similar to the Julian calendar, but it makes a few small adjustments to account for the fact that a solar year is actually about 11 minutes shorter than 365.25 days. These adjustments include: Omitting three leap days every 400 years. This means that the Gregorian calendar only adds a leap day to February every four years, unless the year is divisible by 100 (in which case it is not a leap year) unless the year is divisible by 400 (in which case it is a leap year). Adjusting the rule for when leap days are added. In the Julian calendar, leap days are added every four years. In the Gregorian calendar, leap days are added in years that are divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400. The main reason that the Gregorian calendar was introduced was to correct for errors in the Julian calendar. Over time, the Julian calendar had become slightly out of sync with the solar year, so the dates of the seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter) were slowly shifting. The Gregorian calendar was designed to correct for this error and to keep the seasons in sync with the calendar. The Gregorian calendar is now used by most countries in the world, although a few countries (such as Ethiopia and Iran) still use their own calendars.'\n",
            "'A partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation that involves partial derivatives of a function with respect to two or more independent variables. PDEs are used to describe the behavior of many different physical systems, including fluid flow, heat transfer, and the vibration of structures. An example of a partial differential equation is the heat equation, which describes how the temperature of a solid object changes over time. The heat equation is written as: ∂T/∂t = κ ∂^2T/∂x^2 Here, T is the temperature of the object at a given point in space and time, t is time, x is the position in space, and κ is a constant known as the thermal diffusivity. The partial derivative ∂T/∂t represents the rate of change of temperature with respect to time, and the second partial derivative ∂^2T/∂x^2 represents the rate of change of temperature with respect to space. PDEs are used to model a wide range of phenomena, from the movement of fluids to the distribution of electricity in a circuit. They are an important tool in many areas of science and engineering, and are typically solved using numerical methods or analytical techniques.'\n",
            "\"There are a few things to consider when deciding whether to cancel an existing credit card and open a new one with rewards. Here are some factors to consider:Credit score: Canceling a credit card could potentially affect your credit score, especially if the card has a long history or a high credit limit. This is because canceling a card can lower your credit utilization, which is the amount of credit you're using compared to the amount you have available.Annual fees: If you have an existing credit card with an annual fee, you'll want to consider whether the rewards you'll earn with the new card outweigh the annual fee. If the new card has a higher annual fee, it may not be worth it to switch.Rewards: Consider the rewards offered by the new card and how they compare to the rewards you're currently earning with your existing card. If the rewards on the new card are significantly better, it may be worth it to switch.Other perks: In addition to rewards, consider any other perks or benefits offered by the new card, such as travel insurance, extended warranties, or price protection.Ultimately, the decision to cancel an existing credit card and open a new one with rewards will depend on your individual financial situation and goals. It's a good idea to do some research and compare the terms and benefits of both cards before making a decision.\"\n",
            "\"Hydropower doesn't violate the law of conservation of energy because it converts one form of energy into another. When water falls from a height, it has gravitational potential energy. As it falls, this energy is converted into kinetic energy, which is the energy of movement. When you put a wheel in a waterfall to generate electricity, the kinetic energy of the falling water is used to turn the wheel. This energy is then converted into electrical energy, which can be used to power homes and businesses. The waterfall doesn't lose any energy in this process. Instead, the energy is simply changed from one form (kinetic energy) into another form (electrical energy). The total amount of energy remains the same, it is just being converted from one form to another. So, if you have two identical waterfalls and you put a wheel in one of them to generate electricity, both waterfalls will have the same amount of energy. The difference is that the waterfall with the wheel will be using some of its energy to turn the wheel and create electricity, while the other waterfall will not be doing this.\"\n",

Not all Vietnam Vets were treated poorly by the public : many enlisted soldiers and even more veterans built the GI Resistance movement in the US , offering support and assistance to individual vets while working nationally in alliance with the broad anti - war movement . The worst treatment of vets during and in the aftermath of the war was by the US Government , which failed to provide anything like enough medical support while pouring millions of dollars into military weapons and tactics that the rest of the world considered war crimes .

Water acts like a weak adhesive by creating suction . It is a similar effect that causes two sheets of glass separated by a thin film of water to stick to each other with great force .' 'I remember getting my feet drenched in a downpour while wearing converse and some thick socks ... Practically took my leg off in the end !' 'Intermolecular forces . There are four kinds of intermolecular forces . Water has three . The first is just general dispersion forces , which all molecules and atoms have . This is basically when random movements of electrons create temporary and minor positive / negative charges between two atoms , pulling them together . But these charges are so fleeting though , that this force overall is n't very strong . The next strongest is dipole - dipole , which occurs because of a difference of electronegativities in atoms of a molecule . This occurs in water because Oxygen is much more electronegative ( attracts electrons ) , than Hydrogen . The net effect is an overall partial charge , or dipole , on the water molecule , with a more negative side being on the Oxygen . This then can attract the more positively charged atoms on some other molecule , and so on . The final intermolecular force water has ( and the strongest of all ) is Hydrogen bonding , which can only occur with Oxygen , Nitrogen , and Florine on other molecules . Essentially , O , N , and F are all very electronegative , and so something similar to what happens with dipole - dipole occurs , and a \\\" bond \\\" is formed ( called a bond but not actually ) . Also different from dipole - dipole is the fact these Hydrogen bonds must be done in such a way that the H is essentially pulled by two different highly Electronegative atoms ( one of which is covalently bonded to H , the other Hydrogen bonded ) . This is how the different molecules ( A , T , G , C ) of the rungs of DNA are held together . Anyway , water has all these great IM forces going on , and that means it can create lots of attraction to itself ( cohesion ) and with other molecules ( adhesion ) quite well , ultimately making it hard to pull off your wet clothing . The fourth by the way is ion - dipole , which is just like dipole - dipole , but you have a greater difference in EN ( electronegativity ) , because one of the elements is an ion like Mg2 + or F- .

EDIT : to admit many edits .\",\n          \"You can look at it from a fundamental perspective to see who benefits from rising oil prices. That's a high level analysis and the devil is in the details - higher oil prices may favour electric car producers for example or discount clothes retailers vs. branded clothes manufacturers. Another approach it to use a statistical analysis. I have run a quick and dirty correlation of the various S&P sector indices against the oil prices (Crude). Based on the the results below, you would conclude that materials and energy stocks should perform well with rising oil prices. There again, it is a behaviour you would expect at the group level but it may not translate to each individual company within those groups (in particular in the materials sector where some would benefit and some would be detrimentally affected). You could get exposure to those sectors using ETFs, such as XLB and XLE in the US. Or you could run the same analysis for each stock within the S&P 500 (or whatever index you are looking at) and create a portfolio with the stocks that are the most correlated with oil prices. This is calculated over 10 years of monthly returns after removing the market component from the individual sectors.

When your thyroid is not functioning properly, it can cause your metabolism to slow down, which can lead to weight gain. However, it is still important to pay attention to your diet and exercise, because even if your thyroid is not working correctly, if you are consuming more calories than you are burning, you will still gain weight. So while thyroid problems can contribute to weight gain, it is not the only factor. Does that help clarify things?\",\n          \"When oil and other commodities are traded in dollars, it means that countries around the world need to hold dollars in order to buy these resources. This can be beneficial for the US economy because it means that there is a demand for US dollars. This demand can help to support the value of the dollar and can also make it easier for the US to borrow money, since lenders know that there is a strong demand for the currency. One way to think about this is to imagine that you have a store that sells cookies. If everyone in your neighborhood wants to buy cookies from your store, they will need to pay you in money. This means that they will need to have dollars, which will make the demand for dollars higher. If there is a high demand for dollars, then the value of the dollar will be strong, and you will be able to use it to buy other things that you need. In the same way, when countries around the world want to buy oil and other resources from the US, they need to pay in dollars. This helps to support the value of the dollar and can make it easier for the US to borrow money.\",\n          \"There are a few reasons why your mortgage insurance payment may increase when refinancing an FHA loan:If you are refinancing from a conventional loan to an FHA loan, your mortgage insurance payment may increase because FHA mortgage insurance premiums are typically higher than those for conventional loans.If you are refinancing from an older FHA loan to a newer one, your mortgage insurance payment may increase because FHA mortgage insurance premiums have increased over time.If you are refinancing from an FHA loan with a lower mortgage insurance premium to one with a higher premium, your mortgage insurance payment may increase.If you are refinancing an FHA loan with a fixed rate to an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM), your mortgage insurance payment may increase because ARM loans generally have higher mortgage insurance premiums.It's important to carefully consider the terms of your refinance and the potential impact on your mortgage insurance payment before proceeding. It may be helpful to speak with a mortgage lender or financial advisor to understand the specific reasons for the increase in your mortgage insurance payment and to determine if refinancing is the right decision for you.\\\" \\\"There are a few potential reasons why your mortgage insurance payment might increase significantly when refinancing an FHA loan:You are refinancing into a new loan with a higher interest rate: If the interest rate on your new loan is higher than the rate on your current loan, your mortgage insurance payment may go up, because the mortgage insurance is typically calculated as a percentage of the loan amount.You are increasing the loan term: If you are refinancing into a new loan with a longer term, your mortgage insurance payment may go up, because the mortgage insurance is typically calculated based on the loan term.You are taking cash out: If you are refinancing to take cash out of your home equity, your mortgage insurance payment may go up, because the mortgage insurance is typically calculated based on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, which will increase if you are borrowing more money.Your credit score has decreased: If your credit score has decreased since you took out your current loan, your mortgage insurance payment may go up, because mortgage insurance premiums are generally higher for borrowers with lower credit scores.It's important to carefully consider all of these factors when deciding whether to refinance your FHA loan, and to compare the costs and benefits of different refinancing options to determine which one is right for you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"wiki_csai\",\n          \"finance\",\n          \"open_qa\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
