At that point , I wo n\\'t need to have a large insurance policy - my wife will be able to maintain her standard of living without me . In a worst - case scenario , of course , I die - and my wife and family will be able to get by just as well as if I had not died ( financially , at least ) .

But , the money is 100 % by the government up to $ 250,000 per account . Term life insurance is like car insurance : you buy a set amount ( say $ 1,000,000 ) and pay monthly premiums for it . If you die while you are covered , your dependents or spouse gets $ 1,000,000 worth of coverage for burial expenses , payment of your debts , replacment of your income that you are not making because you are now dead , etc .

Whole life insurance ( the other type ) is - as it sounds - coverage for you whole life and is more like a savings account . You accrue the money that you put into the insurance plan and receive dividends ( interest on the money in the account ) from the insurance company along the way . The dividend rate is better than a the interest rate of a savings account , but not as high as some other investment devices . Your equity grows as time passes and you continue to pay into it . After a while , the account will contain a lot of money and you can access the money to put it towards other investments or purchases .

Many people refer to Natural Gas as the gateway recourse that will link energy and green recourses in the future Cons- Although there are companies that treat Hydro Frac water for recycle and reuse ( thus cutting down on the water and Injection wells ) , it is not widely used and at the moment destroys fresh water . This is especially harmful because places where Fracking commonly takes place is lacking water already ( In Texas : Barnett Shale , Eagle Ford Shale are both big ones ) . Injection Wells eliminates the freshwater from the water cycle completely , effectively destroying the water .

Leaky well casings , massive water consumption , underground injection of fluids , and faceless corporations are n't unique to fracking by any means .

When the Gregorian calendar was invented , Julian was about 10 days off from where it was really supposed to be , so the transition was made by declaring that the day after 4 October 1582 was 15 Oct 1582 ( thus skipping 10 days ) . As other regions started changing from Julian to Gregorian , they too skipped the needed number of days to get to the correct day . For example , the British Empire changed from Julian to Gregorian in the year 1752 ( at this time the Empire included what is now the United States ) . So they had to skip 11 days instead of just 10 . Currently the Julian calendar is 13 days off , so today which is 23 January 2018 , in Julian would be 10 January . ( The other posts mention the difference between the calendar themselves . Which is : in the Julian calendar a leap year is every 4 years , in the years divisible by 4 . In the Gregorian calendar , all common years [ i.e. not leap years ] remain common years , but a few leap years are changed to common years . Divisible by 400 [ e.g. 2000 ] remain leap years , divisible by 100 but not 400 [ e.g. 2100 ] are changed to common years , divisible by 4 but not 100 [ e.g. 2016 ] remain leap years . )']\n",
            "['In mathematics, a partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation which imposes relations between the various partial derivatives of a multivariable function.\\nThe function is often thought of as an \"unknown\" to be solved for, similarly to how x is thought of as an unknown number to be solved for in an algebraic equation like x2 − 3x + 2 = 0. However, it is usually impossible to write down explicit formulas for solutions of partial differential equations. There is, correspondingly, a vast amount of modern mathematical and scientific research on methods to numerically approximate solutions of certain partial differential equations using computers. Partial differential equations also occupy a large sector of pure mathematical research, in which the usual questions are, broadly speaking, on the identification of general qualitative features of solutions of various partial differential equations, such as existence, uniqueness, regularity, and stability.[citation needed] Among the many open questions are the existence and smoothness of solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, named as one of the Millennium Prize Problems in 2000.\\nPartial differential equations are ubiquitous in mathematically oriented scientific fields, such as physics and engineering. For instance, they are foundational in the modern scientific understanding of sound, heat, diffusion, electrostatics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, elasticity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics (Schrödinger equation, Pauli equation, etc). They also arise from many purely mathematical considerations, such as differential geometry and the calculus of variations; among other notable applications, they are the fundamental tool in the proof of the Poincaré conjecture from geometric topology.\\nPartly due to this variety of sources, there is a wide spectrum of different types of partial differential equations, and methods have been developed for dealing with many of the individual equations which arise. As such, it is usually acknowledged that there is no \"general theory\" of partial differential equations, with specialist knowledge being somewhat divided between several essentially distinct subfields.\\nOrdinary differential equations form a subclass of partial differential equations, corresponding to functions of a single variable. Stochastic partial differential equations and nonlocal equations are, as of 2020, particularly widely studied extensions of the \"PDE\" notion. More classical topics, on which there is still much active research, include elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations, fluid mechanics, Boltzmann equations, and dispersive partial differential equations.']\n",

Conan gets a show on TBS , ratings are n't great\", 'Around 2004 , while successful host of \" Late Night \" , Conan and his agents told NBC that other networks ( FOX / ABC ) were interested in bringing him on to compete head to head against Leno at 11:35pm time slot . NBC did n\\'t want to lose their bright talented young star and they negotiated that he would take over \" the Tonight Show \" from Jay in 5 years . NBC did n\\'t think Leno would still be # 1 in 2009 and told him that they would n\\'t renew his contract , and in Leno \\'s words he was \" fired , 5 years in advance . \" Leno keeps a good public face and claims to be voluntarily stepping aside to make way for Conan . Fast forward to early 2009 , months before the planned handover , Leno is still # 1 in the ratings hands down . He had preliminary talks with ABC and Jimmy Kimmel about possibly coming in to do a show as Kimmel \\'s lead - in . NBC did not want Leno to compete against them , and with their own prime time lineup in the toilet ( 4th and 5th place in 8pm-11pm ratings ) , they decide to offer him a new show at 10 pm to kill two birds with one stone . Even if Leno \\'s new show did n\\'t have big ratings , it would still be profitable as it was much cheaper to produce than scripted shows . Leno agrees to a new 5 year contract for \" The Jay Leno Show \" which debuted 3 months after \" The Tonight Show with Conan O\\'Brien \" in Sept 2009 . The ratings for both shows were awful . There were many reasons for the weak ratings . There was no precedent for a late night talk show in prime time . Most people like to watch the talk shows right before bed . Rival networks wanted the show to fail as it \\'s success would disrupt their business model so [ they barred actors on their networks ] ( URL_0 ) from appearing on Jay \\'s show . A significant part of the viewership draw is based on the celebrity guests . With a weaker guest pool , it was harder to land big name guests . People have pretty stable TV viewing habits . Both Conan and Leno \\'s long - time viewers did not alter their TV watching habits to watch their favorite host at a new time . The quality of both shows in general were considered by many to have been weaker than the previous incarnation . Conan was known for his self - deprecating , edgy , random and sometimes weird humor . He scaled it back for the Tonight Show , but his act still did n\\'t play to a wider audience . Conan says he was the fault of a weak lead in and needed more than 7 months to develop his audience . He blamed Jay Leno for the demise . In January 2010 , the local NBC affiliate stations were furious as their ratings for their nightly newscasts at 11 pm were terrible . The affiliates actually own the channels and have deals with NBC to air NBC \\'s original programming . Their local newscasts are a big moneymaker for them . They rely on strong lead - in shows from the previous hour to deliver a large part of their audience . Their nightly news ratings drop was a direct result of weak Leno and Conan ratings . The affiliates threaten to air reruns of scripted shows instead of Leno \\'s show and demanded a change be made . NBC claims for the first time ever in 40 + years , \" The Tonight Show \" was losing money for the network ( Conan vehemently denies this was possible ) . Both Leno and Conan were under contract , around $ 100 m and $ 50 m respectively . NBC proposed a compromise to move Jay back to 11:35 to only do a half hour show , Conan to 12:05 and Fallon to 1:05 . Leno and Fallon agreed while Conan famously publicly refused in an open letter and caused a media firestorm resulting in a two week often public negotiation of his exit and outpouring on the internet hivemind from \" Team Coco \" with most of the support coming from people who did n\\'t even watch his show . Leno claimed NBC told him before he agreed to move that Conan was on board with the change and that NBC would not let him out of his contract , and as he has no agent and represents himself , he did n\\'t want to fight , especially since he did n\\'t want to leave \" the Tonight Show \" in the first place . NBC did n\\'t want to let Leno go , and it was far from certain that Conan could thrive even if Leno left . Conan and others felt that Jay should just retire and step aside as he claimed to be planning the year before , which Leno admits he lied to save face . There is long standing resentment towards Leno from 1992 when he took over the \" Tonight Show \" from Johnny Carson instead of David Letterman . People felt that Leno \" stole \" the Tonight Show from Letterman and again from Conan . A lot of critics find Leno bland as well , as he attempts to appeal to a wide audience with generic material . Conan got paid $ 40m+ to leave and Jay go the Tonight Show back , where he regained the # 1 ratings spot . In my opinion , even as a huge Conan fan , Jay Leno gets an undeserved backlash . Who would turn down $ 100 m while still # 1 ? He says his staff and support crew is like his family and he did n\\'t want to leave NBC and just go to another network . I do n\\'t think his show is any worse than Letterman \\'s , who \\'s been mailing it in the past decade . I think Conan was perfect for 12:35 and never should have asked for the Tonight Show , he would \\'ve gotten it eventually instead of forcing his hand . His show on TBS is good , but he is still bitter about the incident and the ratings are not great . The real big winners are Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon ( if his new show succeeds ) . For more in - depth look , read Bill Carter \\'s book , The War for [ Late Night ] ( URL_1 )', \"A lot of different things happened , but to be blunt , Conan O'Brien did not attract as many viewers as expected . Leno eventually had his own earlier program which could be viewed as a contributing factor in O'Brien 's lack of success . However , even while Leno was still off the air , O'Brien 's new episodes were n't able to beat David Letterman 's reruns . Based on the available information , it appears to simply be that O'Brien was removed because he was unable to attract as many viewers to the Tonight Show as Jay Leno .\"]\n",

It can help provide financial security and peace of mind to your loved ones in the event that you are no longer able to provide for them. Savings accounts are a type of financial product that allow you to save and earn interest on your money. While savings accounts can be a good way to set aside money for the future, they do not provide the same level of financial protection as life insurance. There are two main types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance. Term life insurance is a type of insurance that provides coverage for a specific period of time, such as 10, 20, or 30 years. If you die during the term of the policy, your beneficiaries will receive the death benefit. If you outlive the term of the policy, the coverage will expire and you will not receive any benefit. Term life insurance is generally less expensive than permanent life insurance, but it does not build cash value over time. Permanent life insurance is a type of insurance that provides coverage for your entire life, as long as you continue to pay the premiums. Permanent life insurance policies also have a savings component, which allows you to build cash value over time. This cash value can be used to pay premiums or can be withdrawn or borrowed against. Permanent life insurance is generally more expensive than term life insurance, but it provides lifelong coverage and the ability to build cash value.

They all deal with the chemical and physical properties of the element . The most common are : Atomic Number ( the number of protons ): which essentially defines the element . For example , an oxygen atom is only oxygen if it has 8 protons . Atomic Mass ( the average weight of an atom of this substance ): which says how much the element ways assuming you have the normal distribution of isotopes . Anything else ?', '[ Example : Iron ] ( URL_0 ) The most important number is the element 's atomic number . This is the number of protons in an atom of the element . This is the defining characteristic of the element . ( Usually , an atom will have the same number of electrons as protons \\u2013 this is its uncharged , \\\" un - ionized \\\" form . However , if an atom gains or loses electrons , it remains the same element . If it were to gain or lose a proton , it would be a different element . ) The other number usually printed on a periodic table is the element 's atomic mass . This is the average mass of an atom of the element in multiples of the mass of a proton * . Some atoms of a given element may have more neutrons in the nucleus than others ; an element with a given number of neutrons is called an \\\" isotope \\\" . The number on the table indicates the average mass , as found in nature . Elements that are never found in nature instead have the mass of their most stable isotope shown in parentheses . * The units are actually Atomic Mass Units ( amu ) or Unified Atomic Mass Units ( u ) , also called daltons ( Da ) . They are very nearly precisely the mass of a proton or neutron ( whose masses are themselves almost the same ) .', \\\"So if you look at the periodic table , For each element , the number on the top left is The Atomic Number ( the number of protons ) . It will then give the symbol and then below that is the Atomic Weight ( how many grams it would weigh if you had 6.02 * 10 ^ 23 atoms ) So horizontally , they 're laid out in order of their Atomic number . Some columns are grouped up by the atoms that have the same number of Valence electrons . So Na ( sodium ) and K ( Potassium ) both have 1 valence electron and they 're vertically next to each other on the table . That means they react similarly to other molecules . Both have similar reactions when thrown into water , for example .\",\n          \"Scottsdale ( O'odham Va\\u1e63ai S-va\\u1e63on\\u012d; Yaqui Eskatel) is a city in the eastern part of Maricopa County, Arizona , United States , adjacent to Phoenix .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chatgpt_answers\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 14106,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Inverse problems are problems in which the goal is to determine some property or properties of an object or system from observations or measurements of another related property or properties. Inverse problems often arise in science and engineering, where they are used to infer information about the internal structure, composition, or behavior of an object or system from external observations or measurements. For example, in geophysics, inverse problems are used to infer the composition and structure of the Earth's interior from measurements of its gravitational and magnetic fields. In medical imaging, inverse problems are used to reconstruct images of internal organs or tissues from measurements taken by imaging modalities such as CT scans or MRI. In electrical engineering, inverse problems are used to determine the electrical properties of materials or devices from measurements of their electrical response. Solving inverse problems typically requires the use of mathematical and statistical techniques to analyze the data and make inferences about the underlying object or system.

Security: Some browsers are better at protecting you from online threats like viruses and malware. They may have features like a built-in virus scanner or a warning system that alerts you if you're about to visit a potentially dangerous website. Ease of use: Some browsers are designed to be more user-friendly, with features like easy-to-use tabs and bookmarking tools, or a simple interface that makes it easier to navigate the web. Compatibility: Some websites and web applications may only work properly on certain browsers, so it's important to choose a browser that is compatible with the websites you use most often. Extensions and plugins: Some browsers allow you to add extra features and tools through extensions and plugins, which can be helpful if you want to customize your browsing experience or add specific functionality. Overall, the best internet browser for you will depend on your individual needs and preferences.

Both types of business structure have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the one that is best for you will depend on your specific needs.A sole proprietorship is a type of business that is owned and operated by a single individual. It is the simplest and most common form of business structure, and it offers complete control and flexibility to the owner. However, a sole proprietorship also puts the owner's personal assets at risk, as the owner is personally liable for all debts and obligations of the business.On the other hand, an LLC is a business structure that combines elements of both a corporation and a partnership. It offers the limited liability protection of a corporation, which means that the owner's personal assets are generally not at risk if the business is sued or incurs debts. An LLC also offers more flexibility in terms of management and taxation than a corporation. However, forming and maintaining an LLC can be more complex and costly than a sole proprietorship.Ultimately, the decision between a sole proprietorship and an LLC will depend on your business goals and personal circumstances.

You may get a term life insurance policy for 25 years . Your payout should be at least 5 times your annual income . What does this mean ? The term length sets how long the rate ( amount of money you pay each month ) will be good for ( this case 25 years the insurance company ca n\\'t charge you more for your insurance or cancel your policy . ) Five times your annual salary will ensure that your lazy spouse will have half a decade to stop screwing around a find someone to marry . Whole life will cover your burial , and not a lot more . The good thing about whole life is you can borrow from it when you need .

That sounds like a lot of money , but it \\'s really not - it has to pay for : * My funeral expenses ( about $ 10,000 is usual ) * Child care OR a \" salary \" so that my wife can continue her current lifestyle as if she were still getting my paycheque ( well , a reduced paycheque , but also no bills I would normally accrue ) * My daughter \\'s future ability to attend university . * And possibly , any plans my wife and I had for retirement - I still want her to be able to travel the world or attend university if she wants . My insurance will last for 20 years ; at that point , my premiums will go up if I choose to renew . Now , let \\'s assume the best : I survive this 20 year period . By that point , I will have paid $ 18,000 and gotten nothing in return . However , in 20 years , my mortgage will be fully paid off and my daughter will already be at university ( and her RESP will be maxed out as well ) . At that point , I wo n\\'t need to have a large insurance policy - my wife will be able to maintain her standard of living without me . In a worst - case scenario , of course , I die - and my wife and family will be able to get by just as well as if I had not died ( financially , at least ) .

And then they have to face the facts : they ca n\\'t keep the house without my income , they just might have to scrap any plans of my daughter ever getting a post - secondary education , and they could even end up sinking into poverty . Giving up a new car ? Worth it to me .\\', \\'Not an expert by any means : Savings accounts typically have very low interest rates , not really very useful because they often do not outpace inflation ( which is ~3 % annually ) . But , the money is 100 % by the government up to $ 250,000 per account . Term life insurance is like car insurance : you buy a set amount ( say $ 1,000,000 ) and pay monthly premiums for it . If you die while you are covered , your dependents or spouse gets $ 1,000,000 worth of coverage for burial expenses , payment of your debts , replacment of your income that you are not making because you are now dead , etc . But , regardless of how long you have the coverage - 3 months or 35 years - it is still just $ 1,000,000 no matter how much you have paid towards it . Whole life insurance ( the other type ) is - as it sounds - coverage for you whole life and is more like a savings account . You accrue the money that you put into the insurance plan and receive dividends ( interest on the money in the account ) from the insurance company along the way . The dividend rate is better than a the interest rate of a savings account , but not as high as some other investment devices . Your equity grows as time passes and you continue to pay into it . After a while , the account will contain a lot of money and you can access the money to put it towards other investments or purchases . However , whole - life insurance costs much more than term - 4 or 5x as much , I believe . TL;DR - Savings Account - low interest , essentially zero risk Term Insurance - low rates , short - term coverage , does not accrue equity or pay interest , low risk Whole - life Insurance - high rates , long - term coverage , accrues equity and pays interest , some risk ( someone else probably knows more about this aspect of WLI )'\n",

Injection Wells eliminates the freshwater from the water cycle completely , effectively destroying the water . If you are looking for pro - fracking media , I suggest checking out URL_0\", \"I \\'m an environmental consultant for the EPA , and I think Gasland was a load of propaganda . I ca n\\'t justify using anecdotal evidence and unsupported statements as a scientific basis when I decry anti - vaxxers and climate deniers doing the same thing . Right now , there is no solid evidence that hydraulic fracturing is any worse than conventional extraction . Leaky well casings , massive water consumption , underground injection of fluids , and faceless corporations are n\\'t unique to fracking by any means . Believe me , these are all very bad things , but they happen with conventional wells , too . This is why conventional oil and gas wells are regulated . Unfortunately , * * all hydraulic fracturing wells are exempt from regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act , Clean Water Act , Clean Air Act , and CERCLA ( a.k.a . Superfund ) * * due to an amendment in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 pushed through by Vice President Dick Cheney , who was CEO at Halliburton before the 2000 election . While conventional oil and gas wells are permitted and regulated through a variety of programs ( e.g. EPA \\'s Underground Injection Control program ) , fracking is exempt unless they inject diesel compounds underground ( a rarity ) . TL;DR Fracking is no worse than conventional extraction , except that it is unregulated .'\n",
            "'By \" religious purposes \" , what that means is the calendar is meant to keep us from doing something silly like celebrating Easter in fall .

The Gregorian calendar adds on the rule that every year divisible by 100 is * not * a leap year , except those years which are divisible by 400 . TL;DR : As a result of this , Julian calendar is faster than an actual solar year by one day every 128 years . Gregorian is faster than an actual solar year by one day every 3,030 years . All facts gained from the [ wikipidia article ] ( URL_0 ) on the subject .\\', \"The Julian calendar assumes that a year is 365.25 days , whereas the Gregorian calendar recognizes that a year is 365.25 days -11 minutes .

This is why the year 2000 was not a leap year , even though it should have been . The Gregorian calendar is , therefore , more accurate and that is the reason we use it instead . People might not think the difference is important or useful , but it \\'s important that everyone uses the same calendar , just like it \\'s important for everyone to use the same system of measurement for time , and that system be as accurate as possible . Bonus fun fact : Greece was still using the Julian calendar into 1922 .\", \\'More to the point , the Julian and Gregorian calendars have the same purpose . Julian was invented first . Gregorian was a very slight modification to Julian to be more accurate ( with respect to the actual revolution of Earth around the Sun ) . Julian is not normally used anymore , almost everyone uses Gregorian ( if they use a Christian - based calendar at all ) . We use Gregorian because it is more accurate than Julian . When the Gregorian calendar was invented , Julian was about 10 days off from where it was really supposed to be , so the transition was made by declaring that the day after 4 October 1582 was 15 Oct 1582 ( thus skipping 10 days ) . As other regions started changing from Julian to Gregorian , they too skipped the needed number of days to get to the correct day . For example , the British Empire changed from Julian to Gregorian in the year 1752 ( at this time the Empire included what is now the United States ) . So they had to skip 11 days instead of just 10 . Currently the Julian calendar is 13 days off , so today which is 23 January 2018 , in Julian would be 10 January . ( The other posts mention the difference between the calendar themselves . Which is : in the Julian calendar a leap year is every 4 years , in the years divisible by 4 . In the Gregorian calendar , all common years [ i.e. not leap years ] remain common years , but a few leap years are changed to common years . Divisible by 400 [ e.g. 2000 ] remain leap years , divisible by 100 but not 400 [ e.g. 2100 ] are changed to common years , divisible by 4 but not 100 [ e.g. 2016 ] remain leap years . )'\n",
            "'In mathematics, a partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation which imposes relations between the various partial derivatives of a multivariable function. The function is often thought of as an \"unknown\" to be solved for, similarly to how x is thought of as an unknown number to be solved for in an algebraic equation like x2 − 3x + 2 = 0. However, it is usually impossible to write down explicit formulas for solutions of partial differential equations. There is, correspondingly, a vast amount of modern mathematical and scientific research on methods to numerically approximate solutions of certain partial differential equations using computers. Partial differential equations also occupy a large sector of pure mathematical research, in which the usual questions are, broadly speaking, on the identification of general qualitative features of solutions of various partial differential equations, such as existence, uniqueness, regularity, and stability.[citation needed] Among the many open questions are the existence and smoothness of solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, named as one of the Millennium Prize Problems in 2000. Partial differential equations are ubiquitous in mathematically oriented scientific fields, such as physics and engineering. For instance, they are foundational in the modern scientific understanding of sound, heat, diffusion, electrostatics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, elasticity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics (Schrödinger equation, Pauli equation, etc). They also arise from many purely mathematical considerations, such as differential geometry and the calculus of variations; among other notable applications, they are the fundamental tool in the proof of the Poincaré conjecture from geometric topology. Partly due to this variety of sources, there is a wide spectrum of different types of partial differential equations, and methods have been developed for dealing with many of the individual equations which arise. As such, it is usually acknowledged that there is no \"general theory\" of partial differential equations, with specialist knowledge being somewhat divided between several essentially distinct subfields. Ordinary differential equations form a subclass of partial differential equations, corresponding to functions of a single variable. Stochastic partial differential equations and nonlocal equations are, as of 2020, particularly widely studied extensions of the \"PDE\" notion. More classical topics, on which there is still much active research, include elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations, fluid mechanics, Boltzmann equations, and dispersive partial differential equations.'\n",

NBC settles with Conan , giving him a boatload of money to go away quietly 12 . Leno gets the Tonight Show , but with all the upheaval , ratings are n\\'t great 13 . Conan gets a show on TBS , ratings are n\\'t great\", \\'Around 2004 , while successful host of \" Late Night \" , Conan and his agents told NBC that other networks ( FOX / ABC ) were interested in bringing him on to compete head to head against Leno at 11:35pm time slot . NBC did n\\'t want to lose their bright talented young star and they negotiated that he would take over \" the Tonight Show \" from Jay in 5 years . NBC did n\\'t think Leno would still be # 1 in 2009 and told him that they would n\\'t renew his contract , and in Leno \\'s words he was \" fired , 5 years in advance . \" Leno keeps a good public face and claims to be voluntarily stepping aside to make way for Conan . Fast forward to early 2009 , months before the planned handover , Leno is still # 1 in the ratings hands down . He had preliminary talks with ABC and Jimmy Kimmel about possibly coming in to do a show as Kimmel \\'s lead - in . NBC did not want Leno to compete against them , and with their own prime time lineup in the toilet ( 4th and 5th place in 8pm-11pm ratings ) , they decide to offer him a new show at 10 pm to kill two birds with one stone . Even if Leno \\'s new show did n\\'t have big ratings , it would still be profitable as it was much cheaper to produce than scripted shows . Leno agrees to a new 5 year contract for \" The Jay Leno Show \" which debuted 3 months after \" The Tonight Show with Conan O\\'Brien \" in Sept 2009 . The ratings for both shows were awful . There were many reasons for the weak ratings . There was no precedent for a late night talk show in prime time . Most people like to watch the talk shows right before bed . Rival networks wanted the show to fail as it \\'s success would disrupt their business model so [ they barred actors on their networks ] ( URL_0 ) from appearing on Jay \\'s show . A significant part of the viewership draw is based on the celebrity guests . With a weaker guest pool , it was harder to land big name guests . People have pretty stable TV viewing habits . Both Conan and Leno \\'s long - time viewers did not alter their TV watching habits to watch their favorite host at a new time . The quality of both shows in general were considered by many to have been weaker than the previous incarnation . Conan was known for his self - deprecating , edgy , random and sometimes weird humor . He scaled it back for the Tonight Show , but his act still did n\\'t play to a wider audience . Conan says he was the fault of a weak lead in and needed more than 7 months to develop his audience . He blamed Jay Leno for the demise . In January 2010 , the local NBC affiliate stations were furious as their ratings for their nightly newscasts at 11 pm were terrible . The affiliates actually own the channels and have deals with NBC to air NBC \\'s original programming . Their local newscasts are a big moneymaker for them . They rely on strong lead - in shows from the previous hour to deliver a large part of their audience . Their nightly news ratings drop was a direct result of weak Leno and Conan ratings . The affiliates threaten to air reruns of scripted shows instead of Leno \\'s show and demanded a change be made . NBC claims for the first time ever in 40 + years , \" The Tonight Show \" was losing money for the network ( Conan vehemently denies this was possible ) . Both Leno and Conan were under contract , around $ 100 m and $ 50 m respectively . NBC proposed a compromise to move Jay back to 11:35 to only do a half hour show , Conan to 12:05 and Fallon to 1:05 . Leno and Fallon agreed while Conan famously publicly refused in an open letter and caused a media firestorm resulting in a two week often public negotiation of his exit and outpouring on the internet hivemind from \" Team Coco \" with most of the support coming from people who did n\\'t even watch his show . Leno claimed NBC told him before he agreed to move that Conan was on board with the change and that NBC would not let him out of his contract , and as he has no agent and represents himself , he did n\\'t want to fight , especially since he did n\\'t want to leave \" the Tonight Show \" in the first place . NBC did n\\'t want to let Leno go , and it was far from certain that Conan could thrive even if Leno left . Conan and others felt that Jay should just retire and step aside as he claimed to be planning the year before , which Leno admits he lied to save face . There is long standing resentment towards Leno from 1992 when he took over the \" Tonight Show \" from Johnny Carson instead of David Letterman . People felt that Leno \" stole \" the Tonight Show from Letterman and again from Conan . A lot of critics find Leno bland as well , as he attempts to appeal to a wide audience with generic material . Conan got paid $ 40m+ to leave and Jay go the Tonight Show back , where he regained the # 1 ratings spot . In my opinion , even as a huge Conan fan , Jay Leno gets an undeserved backlash . Who would turn down $ 100 m while still # 1 ? He says his staff and support crew is like his family and he did n\\'t want to leave NBC and just go to another network . I do n\\'t think his show is any worse than Letterman \\'s , who \\'s been mailing it in the past decade . I think Conan was perfect for 12:35 and never should have asked for the Tonight Show , he would \\'ve gotten it eventually instead of forcing his hand . His show on TBS is good , but he is still bitter about the incident and the ratings are not great . The real big winners are Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon ( if his new show succeeds ) . For more in - depth look , read Bill Carter \\'s book , The War for [ Late Night ] ( URL_1 )\\', \"A lot of different things happened , but to be blunt , Conan O\\'Brien did not attract as many viewers as expected . Leno eventually had his own earlier program which could be viewed as a contributing factor in O\\'Brien \\'s lack of success . However , even while Leno was still off the air , O\\'Brien \\'s new episodes were n\\'t able to beat David Letterman \\'s reruns . Based on the available information , it appears to simply be that O\\'Brien was removed because he was unable to attract as many viewers to the Tonight Show as Jay Leno .'\n",

Some of these people are upset because they feel like Oculus was sold to Facebook for a lot of money, and they feel like they didn't get a fair share of the profits. Another reason is that some people are worried about Facebook's privacy practices, and they're concerned that Facebook might collect data from Oculus users and use it in ways that are not transparent or respectful of users' privacy. It's also possible that some people are just generally opposed to the idea of Facebook owning a company that makes virtual reality technology, and they're concerned about the influence that Facebook might have on the direction of Oculus and its products.

            "'Life insurance is a type of insurance that pays a benefit to your designated beneficiaries (such as your spouse or children) in the event of your death. It can help provide financial security and peace of mind to your loved ones in the event that you are no longer able to provide for them. Savings accounts are a type of financial product that allow you to save and earn interest on your money. While savings accounts can be a good way to set aside money for the future, they do not provide the same level of financial protection as life insurance. There are two main types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance. Term life insurance is a type of insurance that provides coverage for a specific period of time, such as 10, 20, or 30 years. If you die during the term of the policy, your beneficiaries will receive the death benefit. If you outlive the term of the policy, the coverage will expire and you will not receive any benefit. Term life insurance is generally less expensive than permanent life insurance, but it does not build cash value over time. Permanent life insurance is a type of insurance that provides coverage for your entire life, as long as you continue to pay the premiums. Permanent life insurance policies also have a savings component, which allows you to build cash value over time. This cash value can be used to pay premiums or can be withdrawn or borrowed against. Permanent life insurance is generally more expensive than term life insurance, but it provides lifelong coverage and the ability to build cash value. I hope this helps explain the difference between life insurance and savings accounts, as well as the difference between term life insurance and permanent life insurance.

When you write a program in a programming language, you are essentially creating a list of instructions for the computer to follow.

In order to initiate a short sale, the borrower must have enough margin in their account to cover the potential loss on the trade, as well as any additional margin requirements set by the broker.To maintain a short position, the borrower must also meet any margin calls that may be issued by the broker. A margin call is a request for the borrower to add more margin to their account when the value of the collateral falls below a certain level.

Here's a simple way to think about it: imagine you have a toy car with a crank on the side. When you turn the crank, it makes the wheels of the toy car spin around. Now imagine that instead of turning the crank by hand, you could use a small explosion to turn it instead. That's kind of how a car engine works. Inside the engine, there are many cylinders (usually 4, 6, or 8) arranged in a line. Each cylinder has a piston that moves up and down inside it. The engine also has a spark plug, which is a small electrical device that creates a spark to ignite the fuel and air mixture in the cylinder.

It involves injecting a mixture of water, sand, and chemicals into the ground at high pressure to create fractures in the rock, which allows the oil and gas to flow more easily and be extracted. There are several arguments for and against fracking: ARGUMENTS FOR FRACKING: Fracking can provide a domestic source of energy: Fracking has helped the United States become less dependent on foreign sources of oil and natural gas. This can help to stabilize energy prices and reduce the need for importing energy from other countries. Fracking can create jobs: The fracking industry employs a large number of people, including engineers, geologists, and truck drivers. Fracking can lower energy prices: Fracking has helped to increase the supply of oil and natural gas, which can lower energy prices for consumers. ARGUMENTS AGAINST FRACKING: Fracking can pollute the environment: Fracking can potentially contaminate the air and water with chemicals used in the fracking process. There have also been reports of methane leaks, which contribute to climate change. Fracking can cause earthquakes: There have been instances where fracking has been linked to small earthquakes in certain areas. Fracking can impact public health: Some people believe that fracking can have negative impacts on public health, including respiratory problems and other health issues.

            "'The Julian calendar is a solar calendar that was used in ancient Rome. It is named after Julius Caesar, who introduced it in 46 BC. The Julian calendar has a regular year of 365 days, with an extra day added every four years to account for the fact that a solar year (the time it takes for the Earth to make one orbit around the sun) is slightly longer than 365 days. This extra day is called a \"leap day,\" and it is added to February. The Gregorian calendar is the most widely used calendar in the world today. It is a solar calendar that was introduced in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII to correct for errors in the Julian calendar. The Gregorian calendar is very similar to the Julian calendar, but it makes a few small adjustments to account for the fact that a solar year is actually about 11 minutes shorter than 365.25 days. These adjustments include: Omitting three leap days every 400 years. This means that the Gregorian calendar only adds a leap day to February every four years, unless the year is divisible by 100 (in which case it is not a leap year) unless the year is divisible by 400 (in which case it is a leap year). Adjusting the rule for when leap days are added. In the Julian calendar, leap days are added every four years. In the Gregorian calendar, leap days are added in years that are divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400. The main reason that the Gregorian calendar was introduced was to correct for errors in the Julian calendar. Over time, the Julian calendar had become slightly out of sync with the solar year, so the dates of the seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter) were slowly shifting. The Gregorian calendar was designed to correct for this error and to keep the seasons in sync with the calendar. The Gregorian calendar is now used by most countries in the world, although a few countries (such as Ethiopia and Iran) still use their own calendars.'\n",
            "'A partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation that involves partial derivatives of a function with respect to two or more independent variables. PDEs are used to describe the behavior of many different physical systems, including fluid flow, heat transfer, and the vibration of structures. An example of a partial differential equation is the heat equation, which describes how the temperature of a solid object changes over time. The heat equation is written as: ∂T/∂t = κ ∂^2T/∂x^2 Here, T is the temperature of the object at a given point in space and time, t is time, x is the position in space, and κ is a constant known as the thermal diffusivity. The partial derivative ∂T/∂t represents the rate of change of temperature with respect to time, and the second partial derivative ∂^2T/∂x^2 represents the rate of change of temperature with respect to space. PDEs are used to model a wide range of phenomena, from the movement of fluids to the distribution of electricity in a circuit. They are an important tool in many areas of science and engineering, and are typically solved using numerical methods or analytical techniques.'\n",
            "\"There are a few things to consider when deciding whether to cancel an existing credit card and open a new one with rewards. Here are some factors to consider:Credit score: Canceling a credit card could potentially affect your credit score, especially if the card has a long history or a high credit limit. This is because canceling a card can lower your credit utilization, which is the amount of credit you're using compared to the amount you have available.Annual fees: If you have an existing credit card with an annual fee, you'll want to consider whether the rewards you'll earn with the new card outweigh the annual fee. If the new card has a higher annual fee, it may not be worth it to switch.Rewards: Consider the rewards offered by the new card and how they compare to the rewards you're currently earning with your existing card. If the rewards on the new card are significantly better, it may be worth it to switch.Other perks: In addition to rewards, consider any other perks or benefits offered by the new card, such as travel insurance, extended warranties, or price protection.Ultimately, the decision to cancel an existing credit card and open a new one with rewards will depend on your individual financial situation and goals. It's a good idea to do some research and compare the terms and benefits of both cards before making a decision.\"\n",
            "\"Hydropower doesn't violate the law of conservation of energy because it converts one form of energy into another. When water falls from a height, it has gravitational potential energy. As it falls, this energy is converted into kinetic energy, which is the energy of movement. When you put a wheel in a waterfall to generate electricity, the kinetic energy of the falling water is used to turn the wheel. This energy is then converted into electrical energy, which can be used to power homes and businesses. The waterfall doesn't lose any energy in this process. Instead, the energy is simply changed from one form (kinetic energy) into another form (electrical energy). The total amount of energy remains the same, it is just being converted from one form to another. So, if you have two identical waterfalls and you put a wheel in one of them to generate electricity, both waterfalls will have the same amount of energy. The difference is that the waterfall with the wheel will be using some of its energy to turn the wheel and create electricity, while the other waterfall will not be doing this.\"\n",

The other 2/3s of the payload was meant to be inanimate , i.e. food , oxygen , water , fuel , construction materials .

            "'API stands for Application Programming Interface . It is literally , how you interface with or use an application from a programming perspective . Lets use an example . On a radio , your interface with the radio is the buttons and knobs provided . Each button is labeled with what its purpose is , so that you can look at the interface and know how to interact with it . If you want more volume , you press the volume up button on your interface . You have no need to know what goes on inside of the box when you press a button , it could really be doing anything and it does n\\'t matter as long as it does what you expect it to in the end . It protects both the user and the creator of the radio . The user does n\\'t have to know that to increase the volume you need to increase the voltage on a certain wire inside the radio and the creator of the radio does n\\'t have to worry about you stealing their design for a radio because it is ( mostly ) protected inside of its box . For programmers , APIs work in much the same way , it allows you to use some part of a program , without knowing the actual code that that program is executing . For example you can interact with Google+ and get information from it or send it information through the API , and you the programmer do n\\'t have to know what is actually happening in the box . And Google does n\\'t have to give you the source code to their stuff which you might take and try to make money off of . Another way to look at an API is that it is a form of contract . It is a contract between the software provider and the programmer that is using it , it basically says that you can call certain methods on the program , and it will do the things specified by the API and give you back the data you are looking for . The contract does n\\'t specify how the work will be done ( in most cases ) , it just specifies what it expects you to pass into the program and what you will get out of it .\", \\'API is like a users manual - for writing code .

Of course , there are some very sophisticated \" permission elevation \" techniques , but those are n\\'t nearly as common because they \\'re a bit more difficult to pull off . In addition to that , most Linux distributions come with what \\'s called a \" repository \" . Basically , a collection of most open - source programs that are available for the operating system , all located in one convenient list for you to download . Ubuntu , for instance , has over 10,000 ( may be much more than that ) programs free to download through the Canonical ( company that owns Ubuntu ) repositories . Each and every piece of software you download is open source , and is from a trusted source . With Windows , you need to download programs from all over the internet , from thousands of sources , more than half of which you probably should n\\'t trust .

With Vista and Win7 , they \\'ve done some improvements ( albeit incredibly obnoxious ) in the user permissions department , and perhaps some memory protection , but they can only do so much with a crufty old OS . * NIX on the other hand , has the convenient ability to have parts rewritten entirely , and is much more feasible to do so with a potential team of 6.5 billion people working on it ( of course the team size is probably more like around a thousand or so for Linux ) .

They also typically are used to run a smaller scope of applications and services as well , making it easier to watch for issues . Ten years ago this was n\\'t the case , but modern Windows servers are probably just about as unlikely to get hit by a virus as a modern * nix servers for the same reasons . They may be more vulnerable to viruses because the same code that runs on your desktop / laptop will run on the server as well , and there are more windows viruses out there , but I \\'d say differences are still likely pretty marginal because servers are fundamentally used differently from desktops . Now targeted hacking , as opposed to a virus , is another story . If you have a talented hacker who wants to get into a specific system , a * nix system has its own vulnerabilities , sysadmins have varying levels of skills , and sometimes people have to run software they know is risky or vulnerable for non - technical reasons . Risk management is the name of the game .

As to capital accounts - these are accounts representing the members/partners' capital in the enterprise, and have nothing to do with the tax treatment of the earnings.

Also, is it true that if the LLC loses money, that loss can be offset against other taxable income resulting in a lower total taxation? It can offset taxable income of the same kind, just like any other losses on your tax return.

While it is possible to use a rail gun to launch a small satellite into space, it would not be the most efficient or cost-effective way to do so. The rail gun would need to be very large and powerful to launch a satellite into orbit, and the projectile would need to be designed specifically for the purpose of carrying the satellite. Instead of using a rail gun, it is usually more practical to use a rocket to launch a satellite into space. Rockets are specifically designed for this purpose and have been used successfully for many decades.'\n",

In order to show ads, Facebook needs to have a large number of users who visit the site regularly and spend a lot of time on it. This is called \"user engagement\". The article you mentioned suggests that Facebook may need to make some changes to its platform in order to continue growing and attracting new users. These changes might involve compromising the user experience, which means making the site less enjoyable or convenient for users in order to achieve a different goal. For example, Facebook might need to show more ads to its users in order to make more money. This could make the site less enjoyable for users, but it might be necessary in order for Facebook to continue growing. Another possibility is that Facebook might need to change the way it collects and uses data about its users in order to comply with new regulations or laws. This could also potentially compromise the user experience, as it might involve asking users for more information or limiting the ways in which they can use the site. Overall, the article suggests that Facebook may need to make some difficult choices in the future in order to continue growing and attracting new users. These choices could involve compromising the user experience in some way, but it\\'s not clear exactly what changes Facebook might need to make.'\n",
            "'Sure! Refrigeration is a way to keep things cold by using a special machine called a refrigerator. A refrigerator works by using a gas called a refrigerant, which is able to change from a gas to a liquid and back again very easily. Inside the refrigerator, there is a part called the compressor. The compressor pumps the refrigerant gas around a closed system of tubes. When the gas is pumped through the tubes, it gets very hot. Next, the hot gas is sent through a part called the condenser. The condenser is made of lots of thin tubes with a lot of space around them. As the hot gas goes through the tubes, it cools down and turns into a liquid. The cooled liquid is then sent through a part called the evaporator. The evaporator is also made of thin tubes, but this time they are inside a box or compartment. The box or compartment is the part of the refrigerator where you keep your food. As the cooled liquid passes through the tubes in the evaporator, it absorbs heat from the air inside the refrigerator. This makes the air inside the refrigerator get colder. Finally, the cooled liquid goes back to the compressor to start the cycle all over again. It gets pumped through the tubes and gets hot again, and the process repeats. So, to answer your question, the electronic power in a refrigerator helps to pump the refrigerant gas around the system of tubes and through the compressor, condenser, and evaporator. This process of moving the gas and changing it from a gas to a liquid and back again is what helps to effectively reduce the temperature inside the refrigerator.'\n",
            "\"Dinosaurs didn't evolve to be as smart as humans because evolution doesn't work that way. Evolution is a process that takes place over many, many generations and it is driven by natural selection. Natural selection is the process by which certain traits that help an organism survive and reproduce are passed down to its offspring. For example, let's say there is a group of dinosaurs that live in a forest. Some of these dinosaurs have long necks, which helps them reach high branches and find food. These dinosaurs are more likely to survive and reproduce, so over time, more and more dinosaurs in the population will have long necks. This is an example of how natural selection can lead to the evolution of a particular trait. However, natural selection doesn't always lead to the evolution of bigger brains or greater intelligence. In fact, many times, smaller brains are more advantageous for survival. For example, small brains require less energy to maintain, which means that the animal can use its energy for other things, like finding food or avoiding predators. So, to answer your question, dinosaurs didn't evolve to be as smart as humans because natural selection didn't favor the evolution of larger brains or greater intelligence in dinosaurs.\"\n",

            "'Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can be deadly if it is not caught and treated early. It happens when the cells that produce pigment in your skin (called melanocytes) grow out of control and form a tumor. Sometimes, these tumors are benign, which means they are not cancerous and are not likely to spread to other parts of the body. Benign tumors can usually be removed and do not usually come back. Other times, these tumors are malignant, which means they are cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body. This is called metastasis. When melanoma spreads, it can be very difficult to treat and can be life-threatening. So, how does melanoma kill you? When melanoma spreads to other parts of the body, it can damage or destroy the tissues and organs it invades. For example, if melanoma spreads to the brain, it can cause headaches, seizures, and other problems with brain function. If it spreads to the lungs, it can cause trouble breathing. If it spreads to the liver, it can cause liver damage. When these organs are damaged or not working properly, it can make it hard for the body to function and can lead to death. As for why some tumors are benign and others are malignant, it is not fully understood. It is thought that certain changes in the DNA of cells can cause them to become cancerous, but more research is needed to understand exactly what causes these changes and how to prevent them.'\n",

            "\"A placebo is a fake treatment that is given to a person with the intention of making them feel better, even though it doesn't contain any medicine or have any real therapeutic effect. The placebo effect is the improvement in a person's symptoms that occurs when they receive a placebo. The placebo effect is thought to work through a person's belief in the treatment. When a person believes that a treatment will help them feel better, their brain may release chemicals that help to reduce pain or improve mood. This response can lead to a decrease in symptoms. There is scientific evidence to support the existence of the placebo effect. For example, studies have shown that people with chronic pain who are given a placebo can experience a reduction in pain, even though the placebo does not contain any active ingredients that would directly affect the pain. To understand the placebo effect, it's helpful to think about the role that the brain plays in how we experience and perceive the world around us. Our brains are constantly receiving input from our senses, and they use this input to create a mental representation of the world. This representation can be influenced by our expectations and beliefs about what is happening to us. When we believe that a treatment will help us feel better, our brain may respond by releasing chemicals that improve our symptoms, even if the treatment itself is not actually doing anything to directly affect our body.\"\n",
            "\"Cells can divide and replicate for a certain number of times, but eventually they stop dividing and die. This process is called cellular senescence. As we age, our bodies accumulate more and more senescent cells, which can no longer divide and perform their functions properly. These senescent cells can also secrete harmful substances that can damage surrounding healthy cells. This accumulation of senescent cells and the damage they cause can contribute to the physical and functional decline that we associate with aging. In addition to cellular senescence, there are other factors that can contribute to aging and death, such as DNA damage, inflammation, and changes in hormone levels. All of these factors can ultimately lead to the breakdown of the body's systems and the onset of age-related diseases. It's worth noting that while aging and death are universal phenomena, the rate at which they occur can vary significantly from one individual to another. There are also things that people can do to help delay the aging process, such as eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding risky behaviors like smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.\"\n",
            "'Eating insects, also known as entomophagy, is actually a common practice in many parts of the world, but it is less common in the Western Hemisphere. There are a few reasons why this might be the case. One reason is cultural. Different cultures have different traditions and practices when it comes to food, and in many Western cultures, eating insects is not a traditional or accepted practice. This can make people feel hesitant or even disgusted by the idea of eating insects, even if they are nutritious. Another reason might be that there are other sources of protein and nutrients that are more commonly available in the Western Hemisphere, such as meat, dairy, and plant-based protein sources. These options may be more familiar and appealing to people in the Western Hemisphere, so they are more likely to choose them over insects. In conclusion, the aversion to eating insects in the Western Hemisphere may be due to cultural traditions and the availability of other protein sources.'\n",

Security features: *NIX-based systems have built-in security features that make it more difficult for viruses to infect them. For example, *NIX systems often use a system called \"permissions\" which controls what actions a program is allowed to perform on the system. This can make it more difficult for a virus to install itself or make changes to the system.

This works pretty well , and you can extract most of the heat gained from burning the fuel this way . However , some heat that \\'s pretty hard to extract in a normal setup is heat that \\'s * stored in the water in the exhaust * . When you burn fuel , the products of that reaction ( assuming complete combustion - so no unburnt fuel ) are mostly carbon dioxide and water ( along with other products that depend mostly on the temperature of the combustion process and the exhaust , like carbon monoxide , nitrous oxide , and other , weirder products ) . Now that water , since it \\'s very hot , is produced in gaseous form ( as water vapor ) , not liquid water .

But it \\'s essentially impossible , in an ordinary boiler , to extract that heat , because if the water condenses on the cold water pipes of the heat exchanger , it would usually just drop back down into the combustion chamber and evaporate again . What a condensing boiler does is that it manages to extract that heat from the water . It takes the exhaust gas from the ordinary boiler ( which is still pretty hot , even after it is used to heat up the water ) and runs that exhaust gas through a second heat exchanger , where it is used to heat up the cold water before it enters the main boiler . Since there \\'s no direct source of heat in the second heat exchanger , the water vapor that \\'s still in gas form when it leaves the main boiler can condense on the heat exchanger tubing into liquid water and release that stored heat into the water ( where you want it to go ! ) instead of just having it go up the chimney with the rest of the exhaust like in a normal boiler . This means you \\'ve extracted more energy from burning the fuel than you could have in an ordinary boiler . As a bonus , it also uses the residual heat from the rest of the exhaust pretty well .

The best examples we have of this situation come from [ feral children ] ( URL_1 ) who have grown up deprived of language contact . Do n\\'t listen to anyone who says that pathological cases make bad examples , because they are our only non - anecdotal examples . Let me make a crucial distinction early on here that this is different from language deprived children who still grew up in a linguistically rich environment , such as deaf children growing up with speaking parents who do not know a sign language . We \\'ll look at those examples in a moment . Feral children show us that thought does exist without language , however complex thought becomes difficult without a linguistic framework to reference . This has a lot to do with the plasticity of the brain . What that means is that the brain is very flexible and able to restructure itself , however the feral children provide evidence that there is a critical period in this plasticity , a period in which the brain is especially flexible , that turns off once they get older and is lost forever . What we find with these children is that they sound and act developmentally disabled , even though there may not be anything wrong with their brain . Concepts beyond their basic needs are hard for them to express , and unfortunately that also makes it hard for us to tell just how thoroughly they actually understand them . Now regarding the deaf children with speaking parents : What typically happens is they develop what we call [ home - signing ] ( URL_0 ) . This is different from actual sign language because it is not a complete and grammatically bound linguistic system . Think of it like when soldiers use hand signals in the field . It gets a general message but is not as refined as actual language . Once again we find that these people are subject to a critical period , but it seems to be extended because their brain is at least being stimulated in some way . Home - sign children put in a sign language environment will quickly learn the sign language , or even create their own if all of the other children are also home - signers . What this shows us is that the capacity for language is innate , and thus inseparably tied to our ability to think . These children who could not before express complex ideas are suddenly able to do so . * * TL;DR * * The question that these two general examples bring up is : how can we tell what a person is thinking if they lack the ability to express it ? Unfortunately this is one of the big questions linguists and psychologists are currently working on . Think of language as the doorway into the mind , and if that door is locked then we can only guess what \\'s inside .\", \"[ Helen Keller ] ( URL_0 ) was blind and deaf so she had no way of learning to speak or to sign ( not that signing was incredibly common when she was a child ) .

We also can design drugs that behave differently in our bodies to make them more useful . By making changes to the chemical structures we can make them absorb better in our stomachs so they get in our bodies faster , or make them slower to leave our blood . If you have a urinary tract infection , a drug that gets in your urine fast is great . If you have a bad case of food poisoning , a drug that stays in the gut rather than being absorbed in your stomach is a better option . So knowing where you are sick and what is causing your illness all are factors in deciding which antibiotics to prescribe .\\', \"It does n\\'t . Antibiotics are like Alcohol . Once applied , it affects whatever it touches and has no bearing on where it goes . Antibiotics are distributed throughout your entire body from pills .

            "\"Very good answers as to how 0% loans are typically done. In addition, many are either tied to a specific large item purchase, or credit cards with a no interest period. On credit card transactions the bank is getting a fee from the retailer, who in turn is giving you a hidden charge to cover that fee. In the case of a large purchase item like a car, the retailer is again quite likely paying a fee to cover what would be that interest, something they are willing to do to make the sale.

            "'A condensing boiler is a type of heating system that is more efficient than a traditional boiler. It works by capturing the heat that is normally lost through the flue (exhaust pipe) of a traditional boiler and using it to heat water, which is then used to heat your home. To understand how a condensing boiler works, it helps to know a little bit about how a traditional boiler works. In a traditional boiler, a fuel (like natural gas or oil) is burned to heat water. The heated water is then sent through pipes to radiators or baseboard heaters, which use the heat to warm the air in your home. The problem with traditional boilers is that when the fuel is burned, not all of the heat is used to heat the water. Some of the heat is lost through the flue, which is why traditional boilers are not very efficient. A condensing boiler, on the other hand, is designed to capture as much of this wasted heat as possible. It does this by using a special type of heat exchanger that is made of metal with a high heat conductivity (like aluminum or stainless steel). This heat exchanger is located inside the flue, and it captures the heat that would normally be lost and uses it to heat the water. The temperature at which a condensing boiler works most efficiently is called the \"saturation level.\" This is the temperature at which the water vapor in the flue gas condenses and turns into a liquid. When this happens, the heat that was previously lost through the flue is captured and used to heat the water, making the boiler more efficient. In summary, a condensing boiler is a type of heating system that is more efficient than a traditional boiler because it captures the heat that would normally be lost and uses it to heat the water. It works best at a certain temperature called the saturation level, which is the temperature at which the water vapor in the flue gas condenses and turns into a liquid.'\n",

The value of a stock option is determined by a number of factors, including the underlying stock price, the option's strike price, the time remaining until the option expires, and the option's implied volatility.There are several methods for valuing stock options, including the Black-Scholes model and the binomial model. These models take into account the aforementioned factors to determine the value of the option, which is known as the option's premium. The premium is the price that the holder of the option pays to the seller in exchange for the right to buy or sell the underlying stock at a future date.In general, the value of a stock option increases as the underlying stock price increases, as the option gives the holder the right to buy the stock at a fixed price. Conversely, the value of the option decreases as the underlying stock price decreases, as the option becomes less valuable if the stock can be purchased for a lower price on the open market. The value of the option also decreases as the expiration date approaches, as there is less time for the underlying stock price to move in a favorable direction.\"\n",
            "\"Banks typically make money on loans by charging interest on the amount borrowed. An interest-free loan would not generate any income for the bank from the interest payments. However, there are other ways that banks can make money on an interest-free secured loan.One way is by requiring the borrower to pay fees for the loan, such as origination fees or closing costs. These fees can help offset the cost of providing the loan and can contribute to the bank's profitability.Another way is by using the loan as a way to attract deposits or other business from the borrower. For example, the bank may offer an interest-free loan as a way to encourage the borrower to open a checking or savings account with the bank, or to use other financial products or services offered by the bank. The bank can then make money from these other sources of business.Finally, the bank may make money on the loan by earning a profit on the sale of the assets that were used as collateral for the loan. For example, if the borrower used a piece of property as collateral for the loan and defaulted on the loan, the bank could sell the property and use the proceeds to pay off the loan and potentially earn a profit.\"\n",

Executive producers are usually involved in the financial and business aspects of the project, rather than the creative aspects. There are no specific guidelines or rules for how executive producers work on different genres of movies or TV shows. The role of an executive producer can vary depending on the specific project and the needs of the production. For example, an executive producer on an action movie might be responsible for coordinating special effects and stunts, while an executive producer on a drama might focus more on casting and script development. Ultimately, the specific responsibilities of an executive producer will depend on the needs of the project and the agreement between the executive producer and the rest of the production team.'\n",
            "\"It's not uncommon for small amounts of pus cells and epithelial cells to be present in a toddler's urine sample. Pus cells, also known as leukocytes, are white blood cells that can be found in the urine when there is an infection or inflammation in the urinary tract. Epithelial cells are cells that line the surfaces of organs and tissues in the body, including the urinary tract. A urine sample with a few pus cells and epithelial cells is generally considered normal for a toddler, and it may not necessarily indicate a problem. However, if the number of pus cells or epithelial cells is significantly increased, or if there are other abnormal findings in the urine sample, it may be a sign of an underlying issue that needs to be addressed. It's also important to note that a single urine sample may not provide a complete picture of your child's urinary health. If you have concerns about your child's urinary tract or if the test results are not normal, it's a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment.\"\n",
            "\"Drinking hot tea in the summer can actually make you feel cooler because it can cause your body to sweat. When your body sweats, it releases moisture through your skin, and this evaporation process helps to cool your body down. Imagine that you are a glass of water. If you are left out in a hot room, the heat from the room will cause the water to evaporate, or turn into a gas. This process absorbs heat, and as a result, the glass of water will feel cool to the touch. The same thing happens when you sweat. The heat from your body causes the sweat on your skin to evaporate, and this process helps to cool your body down. So, when you drink hot tea in the summer, your body sweats more, and the evaporation of this sweat helps to cool you down. It's important to note that this only works if you are in a place with good air circulation. If the air is stagnant and there is no movement, the sweat will not be able to evaporate and cool you down. So, it's best to drink hot tea in a well-ventilated area or in front of a fan to help the sweat evaporate and cool you down.\"\n",
            "\"Sure! The stock market is a place where people buy and sell shares of companies. A share is like a tiny piece of a company that you can own. When the stock market drops 500 points, it means that the value of those shares has gone down by 500 points. This can be bad for people who own shares, because it means that their shares are worth less money. However, it's important to remember that the stock market goes up and down all the time. Sometimes it goes up a lot, and sometimes it goes down a lot. It's normal for the stock market to have ups and downs, and it doesn't always mean that something bad is happening. Overall, a drop in the stock market can be worrying, but it's not always a reason to panic. It's important to talk to a financial advisor or do your own research to understand what's happening and how it might affect you.\"\n",
            "'GOTO is a type of command that allows you to jump to a different part of the program. Some people don\\'t like using GOTO because it can make the code harder to understand. Imagine if you were reading a story and all of a sudden the author said \"Now go back to the beginning of the story\". It would be confusing, right? It\\'s the same with GOTO in a program. It can make it hard to follow what the program is doing, because you have to jump around to different parts of the code. Instead of using GOTO, it\\'s often easier to use other control structures like loops and if statements.'\n",
            "\"Debt can be a good thing for businesses because it allows them to finance growth and expansion. For example, if a business doesn't have enough money to buy a new piece of equipment or to hire more employees, they can take out a loan to pay for these things. This can help the business become more efficient and generate more revenue, which can be used to pay off the loan. Another way that debt can be helpful for businesses is by allowing them to smooth out their cash flow. For example, if a business has a lot of expenses in the short term but expects to make more money in the long term, they can take out a loan to cover their short-term expenses and then use their future revenue to pay off the loan. This can help the business avoid running out of money or having to cut back on important investments. Overall, debt can be a useful tool for businesses, but it's important for them to be careful and make sure they can afford to make the loan payments.\"\n",
            "\"Steampunk is a genre of science fiction and fantasy that is set in a world where steam power is still widely used. It often has a Victorian or Edwardian setting, and the stories often feature technology and design that is inspired by the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century. In the steampunk world, people might use steam-powered machines and gadgets to do things like travel, communicate, and fight battles. These machines might look like they are made out of metal, wood, and other materials that were common during the Industrial Revolution. As far as the rules of the steampunk world go, there are no set rules. Different stories and works of fiction might have different ideas about what is and isn't possible in the steampunk world. Some stories might have advanced steam-powered technology that is beyond what was possible during the Industrial Revolution, while others might be more historically accurate. Overall, the main idea of steampunk is to imagine a world where steam power is still a major part of everyday life, and to have fun with the possibilities that this idea opens up.\"\n",
            "\"It's not uncommon for people to put the names of friends or family members on the title of a property that they are purchasing, but it's important to understand the risks and responsibilities that come with being a co-owner of a property.One risk is financial liability. If the property goes into default or foreclosure, the co-owners may be responsible for paying off any outstanding mortgage debt or other financial obligations associated with the property. Additionally, if the property is sued or involved in a legal dispute, the co-owners may be held liable.Another risk is the potential for conflicts or misunderstandings between the co-owners. It's important to have a clear understanding of each person's rights and responsibilities as co-owners, and to have a plan in place for resolving any disputes that may arise.Before agreeing to be a co-owner of a property, it's a good idea to consult with a lawyer and fully understand the implications of your decision. It's also a good idea to have a written agreement outlining the terms of your ownership, such as the percentage of ownership each person holds and any specific responsibilities or rights that come with ownership.\"\n",

They all deal with the chemical and physical properties of the element . The most common are : Atomic Number ( the number of protons ): which essentially defines the element . For example , an oxygen atom is only oxygen if it has 8 protons . Atomic Mass ( the average weight of an atom of this substance ): which says how much the element ways assuming you have the normal distribution of isotopes . Anything else ?', '[ Example : Iron ] ( URL_0 ) The most important number is the element 's atomic number . This is the number of protons in an atom of the element . This is the defining characteristic of the element . ( Usually , an atom will have the same number of electrons as protons \\u2013 this is its uncharged , \\\" un - ionized \\\" form . However , if an atom gains or loses electrons , it remains the same element . If it were to gain or lose a proton , it would be a different element . ) The other number usually printed on a periodic table is the element 's atomic mass . This is the average mass of an atom of the element in multiples of the mass of a proton * . Some atoms of a given element may have more neutrons in the nucleus than others ; an element with a given number of neutrons is called an \\\" isotope \\\" . The number on the table indicates the average mass , as found in nature . Elements that are never found in nature instead have the mass of their most stable isotope shown in parentheses . * The units are actually Atomic Mass Units ( amu ) or Unified Atomic Mass Units ( u ) , also called daltons ( Da ) . They are very nearly precisely the mass of a proton or neutron ( whose masses are themselves almost the same ) .', \\\"So if you look at the periodic table , For each element , the number on the top left is The Atomic Number ( the number of protons ) . It will then give the symbol and then below that is the Atomic Weight ( how many grams it would weigh if you had 6.02 * 10 ^ 23 atoms ) So horizontally , they 're laid out in order of their Atomic number . Some columns are grouped up by the atoms that have the same number of Valence electrons . So Na ( sodium ) and K ( Potassium ) both have 1 valence electron and they 're vertically next to each other on the table . That means they react similarly to other molecules . Both have similar reactions when thrown into water , for example .\",\n          \"Scottsdale ( O'odham Va\\u1e63ai S-va\\u1e63on\\u012d; Yaqui Eskatel) is a city in the eastern part of Maricopa County, Arizona , United States , adjacent to Phoenix .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chatgpt_answers\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 14105,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Time dilation is a phenomenon that occurs when two objects are in different states of motion relative to each other. If one object is moving very quickly and the other is stationary, time will appear to pass more slowly for the object that is moving. Here's an example: Imagine you have a clock and a stopwatch. You start both at the same time, and then you put the clock on a rocket ship that travels very fast through space. Meanwhile, you keep the stopwatch with you on Earth. When the rocket ship returns to Earth, you compare the time on the clock with the time on the stopwatch. You might find that the clock shows less time has passed than the stopwatch does. This is because time appears to pass more slowly for the clock on the rocket ship due to the effects of time dilation. This phenomenon is predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity, which states that time and space are intertwined and can be affected by the presence of matter and energy. Time dilation is a real effect that has been observed and measured in experiments, and it has important implications for our understanding of the universe.\",\n          \"Fiber-optics is a type of technology that uses thin, flexible strands of glass or plastic to transmit data. These strands are called \\\"optical fibers.\\\" Traditional sources of Internet, like cable or DSL, use metal wires to transmit data. Fiber-optics uses light to transmit data instead of electricity, which allows it to transmit data much faster than traditional sources of Internet. To connect to fiber-optics Internet, you will need a special modem called a \\\"fiber-optic modem.\\\" This modem is connected to a box that is installed by the Internet service provider (ISP). The box is usually located outside of your home or in a utility room. The fiber-optic modem connects to the box using a fiber-optic cable. The modem then converts the data transmitted over the fiber-optic cable into a format that your computer or other devices can understand. In a household, the fiber-optic modem is typically connected to a router, which provides Internet access to all of the devices in your home. The router connects to your devices using cables or a wireless signal. Overall, fiber-optics is a faster and more reliable way to get Internet access than traditional sources, but it may not be available in all areas.\",\n          \"The choice between a sole proprietorship and a limited liability company (LLC) depends on your business goals and personal circumstances. Both types of business structure have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the one that is best for you will depend on your specific needs.A sole proprietorship is a type of business that is owned and operated by a single individual. It is the simplest and most common form of business structure, and it offers complete control and flexibility to the owner. However, a sole proprietorship also puts the owner's personal assets at risk, as the owner is personally liable for all debts and obligations of the business.On the other hand, an LLC is a business structure that combines elements of both a corporation and a partnership. It offers the limited liability protection of a corporation, which means that the owner's personal assets are generally not at risk if the business is sued or incurs debts. An LLC also offers more flexibility in terms of management and taxation than a corporation. However, forming and maintaining an LLC can be more complex and costly than a sole proprietorship.Ultimately, the decision between a sole proprietorship and an LLC will depend on your business goals and personal circumstances. It is a good idea to consult with a legal or financial professional to determine which business structure is best for you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"finance\",\n          \"medicine\",\n          \"wiki_csai\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Atomic Mass ( the average weight of an atom of this substance ): which says how much the element ways assuming you have the normal distribution of isotopes . Anything else ?', '[ Example : Iron ] ( URL_0 ) The most important number is the element 's atomic number . This is the number of protons in an atom of the element . This is the defining characteristic of the element . ( Usually , an atom will have the same number of electrons as protons \\u2013 this is its uncharged , \\\" un - ionized \\\" form . However , if an atom gains or loses electrons , it remains the same element . If it were to gain or lose a proton , it would be a different element . ) The other number usually printed on a periodic table is the element 's atomic mass . This is the average mass of an atom of the element in multiples of the mass of a proton * . Some atoms of a given element may have more neutrons in the nucleus than others ; an element with a given number of neutrons is called an \\\" isotope \\\" . The number on the table indicates the average mass , as found in nature . Elements that are never found in nature instead have the mass of their most stable isotope shown in parentheses . * The units are actually Atomic Mass Units ( amu ) or Unified Atomic Mass Units ( u ) , also called daltons ( Da ) . They are very nearly precisely the mass of a proton or neutron ( whose masses are themselves almost the same ) .', \\\"So if you look at the periodic table , For each element , the number on the top left is The Atomic Number ( the number of protons ) . It will then give the symbol and then below that is the Atomic Weight ( how many grams it would weigh if you had 6.02 * 10 ^ 23 atoms ) So horizontally , they 're laid out in order of their Atomic number . Some columns are grouped up by the atoms that have the same number of Valence electrons . So Na ( sodium ) and K ( Potassium ) both have 1 valence electron and they 're vertically next to each other on the table . That means they react similarly to other molecules .

For example, in geophysics, inverse problems are used to infer the composition and structure of the Earth's interior from measurements of its gravitational and magnetic fields. In medical imaging, inverse problems are used to reconstruct images of internal organs or tissues from measurements taken by imaging modalities such as CT scans or MRI. In electrical engineering, inverse problems are used to determine the electrical properties of materials or devices from measurements of their electrical response. Solving inverse problems typically requires the use of mathematical and statistical techniques to analyze the data and make inferences about the underlying object or system.

Security: Some browsers are better at protecting you from online threats like viruses and malware. They may have features like a built-in virus scanner or a warning system that alerts you if you're about to visit a potentially dangerous website. Ease of use: Some browsers are designed to be more user-friendly, with features like easy-to-use tabs and bookmarking tools, or a simple interface that makes it easier to navigate the web. Compatibility: Some websites and web applications may only work properly on certain browsers, so it's important to choose a browser that is compatible with the websites you use most often. Extensions and plugins: Some browsers allow you to add extra features and tools through extensions and plugins, which can be helpful if you want to customize your browsing experience or add specific functionality. Overall, the best internet browser for you will depend on your individual needs and preferences. It's a good idea to try out a few different browsers to see which one works best for you.\",\n          \"The choice between a sole proprietorship and a limited liability company (LLC) depends on your business goals and personal circumstances. Both types of business structure have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the one that is best for you will depend on your specific needs.A sole proprietorship is a type of business that is owned and operated by a single individual. It is the simplest and most common form of business structure, and it offers complete control and flexibility to the owner. However, a sole proprietorship also puts the owner's personal assets at risk, as the owner is personally liable for all debts and obligations of the business.On the other hand, an LLC is a business structure that combines elements of both a corporation and a partnership. It offers the limited liability protection of a corporation, which means that the owner's personal assets are generally not at risk if the business is sued or incurs debts. An LLC also offers more flexibility in terms of management and taxation than a corporation. However, forming and maintaining an LLC can be more complex and costly than a sole proprietorship.Ultimately, the decision between a sole proprietorship and an LLC will depend on your business goals and personal circumstances. It is a good idea to consult with a legal or financial professional to determine which business structure is best for you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"finance\",\n          \"medicine\",\n          \"wiki_csai\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "\"Sure! When we sleep, our bodies go through a process of repairing and rejuvenating our skin and other tissues. When we don't get enough sleep, our bodies don't have enough time to complete this process. As a result, the skin around our eyes can appear puffier and darker. The skin under our eyes is thin and delicate, and it's common for blood vessels to show through it. When we're well-rested, these blood vessels aren't as noticeable because the skin looks healthy and smooth. But when we don't get enough sleep, the skin under our eyes can appear pale and dull, which makes the blood vessels more noticeable. The skin can also become inflamed, which can make the bags under our eyes look more pronounced. So, in short, lack of sleep can lead to bags under the eyes because it causes the skin to appear pale and inflamed, which makes the blood vessels more noticeable and the bags more pronounced.\"\n",

            "\"There are a few reasons why some people are upset about Facebook's acquisition of Oculus. One reason is that Oculus was originally funded through a Kickstarter campaign, which means that a lot of people backed the company and supported its development before it was acquired by Facebook. Some of these people are upset because they feel like Oculus was sold to Facebook for a lot of money, and they feel like they didn't get a fair share of the profits. Another reason is that some people are worried about Facebook's privacy practices, and they're concerned that Facebook might collect data from Oculus users and use it in ways that are not transparent or respectful of users' privacy. It's also possible that some people are just generally opposed to the idea of Facebook owning a company that makes virtual reality technology, and they're concerned about the influence that Facebook might have on the direction of Oculus and its products. Overall, the main concerns about Facebook's acquisition of Oculus are related to issues of ownership, privacy, and control.\"\n",
            "\"In a criminal trial, the defendant is considered innocent until proven guilty. The prosecution, or the side that is trying to prove that the defendant is guilty, is responsible for presenting evidence and witness testimony to show that the defendant committed the crime. The defense, or the side representing the defendant, is responsible for challenging the prosecution's evidence and presenting their own evidence and arguments to try to show that the defendant is not guilty. As part of this process, the defense lawyer is not responsible for asking the defendant whether they committed the crime. Instead, the lawyer's job is to present a defense for the defendant, which may include questioning the prosecution's evidence and witnesses, presenting evidence and witness testimony on behalf of the defendant, and making legal arguments to try to show that the defendant is not guilty. This process is in place to ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial. It allows the defendant to have an advocate who can present a defense on their behalf, and it also helps to protect against wrongful convictions by requiring the prosecution to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n",
            "'The Pirate Party is a political party that advocates for reform of copyright and patent laws, freedom of information, and government transparency. The party takes its name from the concept of \"internet piracy,\" which refers to the unauthorized copying and distribution of copyrighted material, such as music, movies, and software. However, the party does not condone actual piracy or criminal activities. The Pirate Party is a relatively new political movement, and it has gained some popularity in various countries around the world. The party has run candidates in elections and has been successful in winning seats in national parliaments in some countries. In general, the Pirate Party believes that the current system of copyright and patent laws is outdated and does not adequately protect the rights of creators and innovators. The party also believes that information should be free and easily accessible to everyone, and that governments should be more transparent in their decision-making processes. While the Pirate Party may have a catchy name and some interesting ideas, it is just like any other political party in that it has a specific set of beliefs and goals that it hopes to achieve through the political process.'\n",

There are two main types of sunglasses used by the public : polarized and non - polarized . Polarized does a better job of blocking out UV rays but is often more expensive . A quick test to see if your sunglasses are polarized ( all name brand sunglasses would be , but some knockoffs claim to be and are false ) is when wearing them look at any kind of LCD screen , such as a Phone or Computer monitor . If the glasses are polarized the screen will appear almost unreadable due to the screen being polarized as well . My final thought would be that although polarized sunglasses are superior in eye safety , you do n\\'t necessarily need to buy the > $ 100 glasses as at that price you are indeed paying for the brand Edit Note : changed incorrect LED to correct LCD'\n",

            "\"Sure! When we sleep, our bodies go through a process of repairing and rejuvenating our skin and other tissues. When we don't get enough sleep, our bodies don't have enough time to complete this process. As a result, the skin around our eyes can appear puffier and darker. The skin under our eyes is thin and delicate, and it's common for blood vessels to show through it. When we're well-rested, these blood vessels aren't as noticeable because the skin looks healthy and smooth. But when we don't get enough sleep, the skin under our eyes can appear pale and dull, which makes the blood vessels more noticeable. The skin can also become inflamed, which can make the bags under our eyes look more pronounced. So, in short, lack of sleep can lead to bags under the eyes because it causes the skin to appear pale and inflamed, which makes the blood vessels more noticeable and the bags more pronounced.\"\n",

            "\"There are a few reasons why some people are upset about Facebook's acquisition of Oculus. One reason is that Oculus was originally funded through a Kickstarter campaign, which means that a lot of people backed the company and supported its development before it was acquired by Facebook. Some of these people are upset because they feel like Oculus was sold to Facebook for a lot of money, and they feel like they didn't get a fair share of the profits. Another reason is that some people are worried about Facebook's privacy practices, and they're concerned that Facebook might collect data from Oculus users and use it in ways that are not transparent or respectful of users' privacy. It's also possible that some people are just generally opposed to the idea of Facebook owning a company that makes virtual reality technology, and they're concerned about the influence that Facebook might have on the direction of Oculus and its products. Overall, the main concerns about Facebook's acquisition of Oculus are related to issues of ownership, privacy, and control.\"\n",
            "\"In a criminal trial, the defendant is considered innocent until proven guilty. The prosecution, or the side that is trying to prove that the defendant is guilty, is responsible for presenting evidence and witness testimony to show that the defendant committed the crime. The defense, or the side representing the defendant, is responsible for challenging the prosecution's evidence and presenting their own evidence and arguments to try to show that the defendant is not guilty. As part of this process, the defense lawyer is not responsible for asking the defendant whether they committed the crime. Instead, the lawyer's job is to present a defense for the defendant, which may include questioning the prosecution's evidence and witnesses, presenting evidence and witness testimony on behalf of the defendant, and making legal arguments to try to show that the defendant is not guilty. This process is in place to ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial. It allows the defendant to have an advocate who can present a defense on their behalf, and it also helps to protect against wrongful convictions by requiring the prosecution to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n",
            "'The Pirate Party is a political party that advocates for reform of copyright and patent laws, freedom of information, and government transparency. The party takes its name from the concept of \"internet piracy,\" which refers to the unauthorized copying and distribution of copyrighted material, such as music, movies, and software. However, the party does not condone actual piracy or criminal activities. The Pirate Party is a relatively new political movement, and it has gained some popularity in various countries around the world. The party has run candidates in elections and has been successful in winning seats in national parliaments in some countries. In general, the Pirate Party believes that the current system of copyright and patent laws is outdated and does not adequately protect the rights of creators and innovators. The party also believes that information should be free and easily accessible to everyone, and that governments should be more transparent in their decision-making processes. While the Pirate Party may have a catchy name and some interesting ideas, it is just like any other political party in that it has a specific set of beliefs and goals that it hopes to achieve through the political process.'\n",

You 're also quite warm .\\\", \\\"Cats have over and undercoatings of fur and when they are wet it is probably just really uncomfortable . That said , some cats actually do enjoy going for a swim . Cats have really sensitive pads on their feet and it probably bothers them .

They all deal with the chemical and physical properties of the element . The most common are : Atomic Number ( the number of protons ): which essentially defines the element . For example , an oxygen atom is only oxygen if it has 8 protons . Atomic Mass ( the average weight of an atom of this substance ): which says how much the element ways assuming you have the normal distribution of isotopes . Anything else ?', '[ Example : Iron ] ( URL_0 ) The most important number is the element 's atomic number . This is the number of protons in an atom of the element . This is the defining characteristic of the element . ( Usually , an atom will have the same number of electrons as protons \\u2013 this is its uncharged , \\\" un - ionized \\\" form . However , if an atom gains or loses electrons , it remains the same element . If it were to gain or lose a proton , it would be a different element . ) The other number usually printed on a periodic table is the element 's atomic mass . This is the average mass of an atom of the element in multiples of the mass of a proton * . Some atoms of a given element may have more neutrons in the nucleus than others ; an element with a given number of neutrons is called an \\\" isotope \\\" . The number on the table indicates the average mass , as found in nature . Elements that are never found in nature instead have the mass of their most stable isotope shown in parentheses . * The units are actually Atomic Mass Units ( amu ) or Unified Atomic Mass Units ( u ) , also called daltons ( Da ) . They are very nearly precisely the mass of a proton or neutron ( whose masses are themselves almost the same ) .', \\\"So if you look at the periodic table , For each element , the number on the top left is The Atomic Number ( the number of protons ) . It will then give the symbol and then below that is the Atomic Weight ( how many grams it would weigh if you had 6.02 * 10 ^ 23 atoms ) So horizontally , they 're laid out in order of their Atomic number . Some columns are grouped up by the atoms that have the same number of Valence electrons . So Na ( sodium ) and K ( Potassium ) both have 1 valence electron and they 're vertically next to each other on the table . That means they react similarly to other molecules . Both have similar reactions when thrown into water , for example .\",\n          \"Scottsdale ( O'odham Va\\u1e63ai S-va\\u1e63on\\u012d; Yaqui Eskatel) is a city in the eastern part of Maricopa County, Arizona , United States , adjacent to Phoenix .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

If one object is moving very quickly and the other is stationary, time will appear to pass more slowly for the object that is moving. Here's an example: Imagine you have a clock and a stopwatch. You start both at the same time, and then you put the clock on a rocket ship that travels very fast through space. Meanwhile, you keep the stopwatch with you on Earth. When the rocket ship returns to Earth, you compare the time on the clock with the time on the stopwatch. You might find that the clock shows less time has passed than the stopwatch does. This is because time appears to pass more slowly for the clock on the rocket ship due to the effects of time dilation. This phenomenon is predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity, which states that time and space are intertwined and can be affected by the presence of matter and energy. Time dilation is a real effect that has been observed and measured in experiments, and it has important implications for our understanding of the universe.\",\n          \"Fiber-optics is a type of technology that uses thin, flexible strands of glass or plastic to transmit data. These strands are called \\\"optical fibers.\\\" Traditional sources of Internet, like cable or DSL, use metal wires to transmit data. Fiber-optics uses light to transmit data instead of electricity, which allows it to transmit data much faster than traditional sources of Internet. To connect to fiber-optics Internet, you will need a special modem called a \\\"fiber-optic modem.\\\" This modem is connected to a box that is installed by the Internet service provider (ISP). The box is usually located outside of your home or in a utility room. The fiber-optic modem connects to the box using a fiber-optic cable. The modem then converts the data transmitted over the fiber-optic cable into a format that your computer or other devices can understand. In a household, the fiber-optic modem is typically connected to a router, which provides Internet access to all of the devices in your home. The router connects to your devices using cables or a wireless signal. Overall, fiber-optics is a faster and more reliable way to get Internet access than traditional sources, but it may not be available in all areas.\",\n          \"The choice between a sole proprietorship and a limited liability company (LLC) depends on your business goals and personal circumstances. Both types of business structure have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the one that is best for you will depend on your specific needs.A sole proprietorship is a type of business that is owned and operated by a single individual. It is the simplest and most common form of business structure, and it offers complete control and flexibility to the owner. However, a sole proprietorship also puts the owner's personal assets at risk, as the owner is personally liable for all debts and obligations of the business.On the other hand, an LLC is a business structure that combines elements of both a corporation and a partnership. It offers the limited liability protection of a corporation, which means that the owner's personal assets are generally not at risk if the business is sued or incurs debts. An LLC also offers more flexibility in terms of management and taxation than a corporation. However, forming and maintaining an LLC can be more complex and costly than a sole proprietorship.Ultimately, the decision between a sole proprietorship and an LLC will depend on your business goals and personal circumstances. It is a good idea to consult with a legal or financial professional to determine which business structure is best for you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
